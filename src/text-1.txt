<p>Relational databases are set based by definition, declarative in nature.  Object-oriented languages are object-instance based.  Making the two work together is difficult because of ""object-relational impedance mismatch"".   This is why you see so many ORM solutions (e.g. TopLink, Hibernate, etc.)  All of them are trying to fool object-oriented programmers into thinking that they only need deal with objects and not worry about relational databases.</p>

",1349050476,12666246,False,"<p>Philosophical question here
When it comes to OOP and databases, specifically, programs where the classes are backed up with databases, what is the best way to approach this? For instance, a team class might have a collection of players. The program would just load all of the team data from the database at startup, do all the manipulation in memory, and then write the database at close. Or is it better to write each data manipulation to the database as changes occur? And if this is the better way, why load the data into memory in the first place?</p>

<p>The other concern is that it seems to me that databases break standard OOP in one important way. With my team class with the collection of players, using OOP, the player class would not need to have a property to hold the team name. The player would get the team name from the team class of which it is a member. Now, to save the player in the database, each player record will have to have a column for the team name (or team id, but that's the same thing).</p>

<p>In other words, if you needed a GetAllPlayers() method, would you make it a member method in the team class, to return from memory all of the players in the collection, or make a static method in the player class to get all of the players from the database? </p>

12666248,"<p>Per my understanding, each executable object has its own ""lookup scope"":</p>

<ul>
<li>The main executable is usually the first object in the ""global"" lookup scope.   This means that symbols defined in the main executable would override those in dependent shared libraries.  Shared objects that are added using the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> facility are added to the global lookup scope, right after the main executable.</li>
<li>However, if the shared object being loaded uses the <code>DF_SYMBOLIC</code> flag, then symbol references that originate within that object will look for definitions within the object before searching in the global lookup scope.</li>
<li>Shared objects opened using <code>dlopen()</code> may have their own dependencies.  If the <code>RTLD_GLOBAL</code> flag was not set during the call to <code>dlopen()</code>, these dependencies are added to the lookup scope for that object, but do not affect the global lookup scope.  If the <code>RTLD_GLOBAL</code> flag was passed to <code>dlopen()</code>, then the shared object (and its dependencies) will be added to the ""global"" lookup scope, changing the behavior of subsequent symbol lookups.</li>

  <p>is it a good idea to run each task on a separate thread</p>

<p>It sounds like a good idea to split your program into threads since the 2 tasks can work asynchronously and concurrently.  The 1st thread could be downloading at the same time the 2nd one is uploading.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how do I lock the folder when it's used by either task to avoid interference?</p>

<p>I wouldn't do a lock at all.  I'd have your 1st thread read a file from the server, write it into the folder, and then add a <code>FileToSend</code> object (or maybe just a <code>File</code> object) to a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>BlockingQueue</code></a>.  So instead of looking at the directory, your 2nd thread would just be waiting on the <code>BlockingQueue</code> for files to be sent to the server.  The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>LinkedBlockingQueue</code></a> class should work well for this.  The <code>BlockingQueue</code> takes care of the locking for you.</p>

<p>A good pattern would be to define an <code>addFileToUpload(File fileToUpload)</code> method on your <code>Uploader</code> class.  Then your <code>Uploader</code> can decide what to do with it.  The <code>BlockingQueue</code> could then be local to the <code>Uploader</code></p>

I've temporarily lost my CodePlex account details, but when I get them back I'll submit an Issue report on the problem. I also note that this issue could present a Denial-of-Service attack vulnerability to any site that uses HtmlAgilityPack to sanitize user-submitted HTML - a crafted overly-nested HTML document would cause the w3wp.exe process to die.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I figured the best way forward is to manually override the maximum thread stack size. I was wrong in my earlier statement that a bigger stack-size means that all threads automatically consume that memory (it seems memory pages are allocated for a thread stack as it grows, not all-at-once).</p>

<p>I made a copy of the <code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;</code> page and ran some experiments. I found that my program failed when the stack size was less than <code>2^21</code> bytes in size, but a maximum size of <code>2^22</code> succeeded - that's 4MB and in my book passes as an ""acceptable"" hack... for now.</p>

My question is not about any of these steps.</p>

<p>Rather my question is about how to handle parsing an .xml file that contains more than one order in it.</p>

    modlist.append (""%s"" % (element.get('value')))

for element in root.iter('upgrade'):
    modlist.append (""%s"" % str.upper((element.get('type'))))
</code></pre>

<p>and it would give me a list called <code>modlist</code> like <code>['Model1', 'Leather Seats', '6-Disc CD Player']</code> which I can run through my other functions to get the ID numbers for those items and from there get the price information and total it up to find out how much this Model1 car with a Leather Seat upgrade and a 6-Disc CD Player upgrade would cost.</p>

  <p>Which operand determines the bit width that the operation is performed with, or is it the larger of the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the bit-shifts, it's the left operand (the one to be shifted) that determines the type that the operation is performed with. If the integer promotions convert it to <code>int</code> or <code>unsigned int</code>, the operation is performed at that type, otherwise at the type of the left operand.</p>

<p>For the comparison, the result of the shift may then be converted to the type of the other operand. In your example code, the integer constant <code>1</code> has type <code>int</code>, hence the shift would be performed at type <code>int</code>, and the result of that converted to <code>unsigned long long</code> for the comparison. Casting works, since the result has a type that is not changed by the integer promotions, as would using a suffixed literal <code>1ull</code>.</p>

<p>For the other listed operations, the arithmetic operations (as for comparisons), the type at which the operation is performed is determined by both operands as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, the integer promotions are performed on both operands. Then the following rules are applied to the promoted operands:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.</li>

<p>However, when I try to set the image on the button the button gets all weird looking and the corners do not match the standard corner radius of a regular UIButton.</p>

<p>I have tried creating several different sizes of images but nothing I do seems to work.</p>

<p>I know the caps are supposed to be even and I have that plus the 1 pixel middle to stretch.</p>

<p>My UIButton is 44 high. If I create an image that is 44 pixels high and 21 pixels wide and has the same rounded corner radius as the default button (it likes an aspirin caplet) and set my background image like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIImage *btnImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@""buttontest1.png""];
UIImage *newImg = [btnImage stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:10 topCapHeight:0];
</code></pre>

<p>the corners just don't match and look weirdly widely stretched AND the button grows in height!</p>

<p>I know the stretchableImagewithLeftCapWidth is deprecated but the usage of resizableCapWithInsets makes even less sense to me and when I try to do that the button image just seems to repeat over and over.</p>

<p>Can anyone figure out what I'm doing wrong? Is there anyplace that explains this crap simply? I just cannot seem to get it.</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>EDIT - adding images after using the resizableImageCapWithInserts to show results. They can't be typical as I see examples all over that supposedly work but the examples never work for me. I just figured out how to add images here so maybe this helps some.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lVAOb.png"" alt=""My PNG file 21pxels wide by 29 pixels tall"">
Here is the PNG file 21px wide by 39px tall</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/DC9R5.jpg"" alt=""Results of my code"">
This is the result of using the following code to set the background image:</p>

<pre><code>[self.button1 setBackgroundImage:[[UIImage imageNamed:@""buttontest4.png""] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 10, 0, 10)] forState:UIControlStateNormal];
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it this should copy the left 10 pixels and right 10 pixels of my 21 pixel wide image as is and stretch the middle 1 pixel across, which it appears to do but it is also making my button get larger vertically and I'm getting this weird repeat. It should be the same size as the BTN next to it.</p>

<p>Here is my Xcode layout:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9TVq.png"" alt=""Xcode layout""></p>

<p>No matter what image I use I see similar results.</p>

<p>I'm obviously not groking something here.</p>

<p>I appreciate the answers so far. It's becoming slightly less foggy.</p>

<p>EDIT2: showing samples using the cap insets method with image 21px by 44px.</p>

<p>All 4 buttons are 44px high when designed in storyboard.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kZzpS.jpg"" alt=""both buttons 44px high"">
As you can see the orange buttons are both larger than the white buttons for scale comparison.</p>

<p>The top button is button1, bottom is button2.</p>

<p>I found a way to get it closer by using the optional resizingMode parameter of UIImageResizingModeStretch.</p>

<p>However, notice the buttons are larger than what they should be.</p>

<p>Here is the code for setting the button images. </p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
[super viewDidLoad];
// Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

[self.button1 setBackgroundImage:[[UIImage imageNamed:@""buttontest1a.png""] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 10, 10, 10)] forState:UIControlStateNormal];

[self.button2 setBackgroundImage:[[UIImage imageNamed:@""buttontest1a.png""] resizableImageWithCapInsets:UIEdgeInsetsMake(0, 10, 0, 10) resizingMode:UIImageResizingModeStretch]  forState:UIControlStateNormal];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Doing the top image with (10,10,10,10) gets me an image that does not repeat the top part of the image like previously. I know the top image is not using the optional resize parameter as this is a test to see what each gets me.</p>

<p>Now, to complicate things even more. If I set my top button size to 43, that is one pixel smaller than my image and make a call with the optional resize parameter I get nearly perfect results except my button is not the right size.</p>

<p>What the heck is going on here?</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone who is trying to pound some knowledge through my thick skull.

<p>The correct programs I was testing this against used the UDP protocol, and this program is written in TCP. The corrected code is:</p>

public static void main(String[] args) {
    //Serverport is 10085, our client is 10086

        DatagramSocket clientSocket = new DatagramSocket();
        InetAddress IPAddress = InetAddress.getByName(args[0]);
        int portToSend = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
        System.out.println(""Clent Socket Created"");
        byte[] toSend = new byte[5];

        clientSocket.send(sendPacket);          
        System.out.println(""Sent Request. Waiting for reply...\n"");

        DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(echoSocket.getInputStream());
        toRecieve can either be an error message, a return of what we sent,
        or a byte stream full of IP info and port numbers.
        the ""heavy"" byte stream is either 4 for IPv4 of 16 for IPv6, 2 bytes for port,
        and the magic number (2 bytes) for a total of 9-20 bytes*/

<p>I also have some questions about my implementation regarding receiving messages in Java. I'll be getting a datagram that contains either:</p>

<p><strong>a)</strong> 3 formatting bytes (unimportant to the question) along with an IP and port number </p>

<p>or</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong> 3 formatting bytes and a port.</p>

<p>Is using a DataInputStream the correct way to do this? I know using an array with 9 elements is lazy instead of dynamically allocating one that's either 5 or 9, but right now I'm just trying to get this working. That being said, is there a different approach anyone would suggest for this?</p>

Furthermore I think I'd be cool that if the confidence in the recommendation is high, I can tell the customer why I'm recommending that.</p>

<p>You can certainly create a Federation(s) within an existing DB. There is no limitation to creating Federations in just a new/empty DB. However, creating a federation in an Active DB will do nothing for you. You have to realize that Federations are separate DBs.

So you have to think on migrating schema/data from the Active DB (or the Federations Root) once you create your federation. </p>

<p>Most probably YES. Windows Azure SQL Database Federations is a Scale-Out mechanism for the DB tier. This means, that like any Web Application needs a ""special"" design to work in a farm-like environment (i.e. scale-out environment like Windows Azure), a DataBase will also need a ""special"" design to work in a scale-out environment. There is no magic-wand with SQL Azure Federations that will make your code work. You have to design it to Work.</p>

  <p>3) When I split my database and after some time I see that one of the

  federations? - Do I need to split only that single federated table

  using a a less broader range. The problem is that one specific user
  can be very active, so what strategy I use to making sure that I won't
  need to re-create the federated strategy due to one very active
  federated table / user?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all about partitioning strategy. You have to very carefully design your federation key and how you partition your data across different shards. You can always SPLIT any federation, as long as you keep the Atomic Units in single shard.</p>

<p>If you want to split different tables on different keys, than you will have different federations, each one with its own federation key and own tables. </p>

<p>A good video worth watching if you are up for SQL Federations: <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/DBI408"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/DBI408</a> </p>
",1349073052,12668445,True,"<p>I have a few questions regarding Microsoft SQL Azure Federations:</p>

<p>1) Can I created a federated DB on an active Database or do I need to deploy federations ahead of time?</p>

<p>2) Do I need to make any changes to the SQL queries to comply with how I query federations, or I can continue to use my regular queries as I was working against one SQL Server Database?</p>

<p>3) When I split my database and after some time I see that one of the shards is very busy and almost full, how I tackle this problem using federations? - Do I need to split only that single federated table that is 90% full, or I need to recreate the splitting strategy by using a a less broader range. The problem is that one specific user can be very active, so what strategy I use to making sure that I won't need to re-create the federated strategy due to one  very active federated table / user?</p>

<p>4) When I have different tables that I want to split with different primary keys, how the sharding will work then.  for example:</p>

<p>From what I understand:</p>

<p>[Blogs]</p>

<p>blog_id</p>

<p>info</p>

<p>[Blog_Posts]</p>

<p>id</p>

<p>blog_id</p>

<p>post_content</p>

<p>So if I decide to shard based on the blog_id from 0-1000, 1-2001 I will have two federated tables. But how much more federated tables I have if I add more tables that have different keys other than blog_id, will I have more federated tables?</p>

<p>The dictionary it originally used was the Cracklib word list, which contains any number of obscure, recherch&eacute; terms, which is appropriate in a Cracklib password checking dictionary, but frustratingly opaque to a user (""I'm supposed to remember 'Menkar' as a word???"").

No problem with drawing the lines to the center of the object but I'd like them to appear in front of anything else on the scene so that they are visible even if other objects are in front - Like in Blender.</p>

<p>I tried to play with the renderDepth param but I don't think I understood how to use it and I didn't get any result.</p>

12666581,"<p>What you are looking for can be achieved a few different ways. The easiest would be via a AJAX POST via jquery. I'll give you a little example:</p>

<p>Let's pretend your search input has a name attribute such as ""keywords""</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){  
  $(""input[name='keywords']"").keyup(function(){
    $("".search_results"").slideUp(""normal"", function(){
      $.ajax({  
        type: ""POST"", url: ""searchquery.php"", 
        data: {keywords: $(this).val()},
        success: function(response){
          if(response != ""error"")
          {
            $("".search_results"").html(response);
            $("".search_results"").slideDown();
          }
          else
          {
            alert(""Error Searching. Please refresh the page and try again."");
          }
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to have searchquery.php handle searching the database and returning the data in html format. Maybe something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(trim($_POST[""keywords""]) != """")
{
  $keywords = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST[""keywords""]);

  //search the DB for maybe 5 top results and return them in something like a HTML list:
  $results = '&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;second&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;';

  die($results);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your on your own for formatting the div or HTML object with the class ""search_results"" defined on it.</p>

<p>Also, I would advise adding a timer, so that each time the ""keyup"" function is hit, it records the time and make a minimum of <strong>_</strong> amount of time before the next call to the file is allowed. That way the PHP file doesn't get 5 calls when someone writes 1 word.</p>

12666590,"<p>My first question is to ask what is it that you're trying to send?  The first thing to understand is that there are 2 different ways of ""sending email"" on form submission.  One is the standard sort of out of the box task that comes with Sitecore.  The other is a much more robust email that uses the Email Campaign Manager module.  It makes a huge difference since those 2 sending tasks have very different ways in which they handle building the email and there's obviously something going wrong, but it's impossible to say without more info.  I'd have to see more about how you have configured your send action and some of the log files to understand for sure. </p>

<p>If it were up to me, though, I'd also go create a standard message via the ECM module (if you have it) and use that instead.  As I said, it's much more robust and can be used to do the exact same thing with some additional bells and whistles if you wanted them. </p>

Doubles give exact solutions only to about the 85th Fibonacci number.</p>

<p>If you want a fast and accurate calculation you're better off using an algorithm based on a better recurrence relationship, and using python bignum integers.</p>

<p>In particular you can use:</p>

<pre><code> fib(2*n) = fib(n)^2 + fib(n-1)^2
 fib(2*n-1) = fib(n)*(2*fib(n-1)+fib(n))

 [ F_{n-1} F_{n-2} ]      [ 1   0 ]

When the user clicks a treenode, the server-side code gets the node value (file path), creates a FileInfo object, and (after setting all the header Content-type, Cache-Control, etc. correctly) calls Response.TransmitFile(xxxxpath) to send to the user's browser.</p>

<p>This works fine on the major browsers, on major devices (PCs, Macs, iOS devices). The file downloads correctly and opens on the user's machine. But on certain devices and certain browsers, the PDF file does not open. On Android devices, it appears that Firefox downloads and opens the PDFs correctly, but the stock Android browser does not. On a Kindle Fire, it appears the Silk browser downloads the file successfully, but when trying to open it, I see an error: ""PDF trailer not found""....or it says the PDF is DRM-protected (which it is not). I haven't tried another browser (if there is one) on the Fire.</p>

<p>I've experimented using anchor  links in static HTML markup, and the problem browsers appear to download and display the PDFs correctly when accessed this way.

<p>The exact details will vary from compiler to compiler and operating system to operating system. If min() or max() had arguments or return values, they would be passed as appropriate for the architecture. The key point is that the compiler has already worked out what the arguments and return values are and created machine code that just passes or accepts them. </p>

<p>You can learn more details if you wish to help with debugging or to do low level calls but be aware that the machine code emitted can be highly variable. For example, here is the same code compiled on the same system in release mode (i.e. with optimizations on):</p>

<pre><code>return 0;
01151270  xor         eax,eax  
}
01151272  ret 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it has detected that <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> do nothing and removed them completely. Since there is now no stack frame to setup and restore, that is gone, leaving a single instruction to set eax to 0 then returning (since the return value is in the eax register).</p>

<p>I base my conclusion on your error message - specifically the following portion of it: <code>""""==""""</code>. The error message is a batch parsing error, and I don't see how your code could generate those characters. So I figure ant must be a batch script that is causing the problem.</p>

<p>I suspect ant.bat has <code>@echo off</code> at the top, so you are not seeing the actual line that is failing.</p>

<p>masked_array is <em>not</em> for making masks. It's for including only the data outside the mask in calculations such as sum, mean, etc.. scientific statistical applications. It's comprised of an array and the mask for the array.
It's probably NOT what you want.</p>

<p>You probably just want a normal boolean mask, as in:</p>

<pre><code>mask = diff&gt;1
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'll need to modify the shape so numpy broadcasts in the correct dimension, then broadcast it into the 3rd dimension:</p>

<pre><code>mask.shape = mask.shape + (1,)
mask = np.broadcast_arrays(img1Array, mask)[1]
</code></pre>

<p>After that, you can just add the pixels:</p>

<pre><code>img1Array[mask] += img2Array[mask]
</code></pre>

<p>A further point of clarification:</p>

<pre><code>imgResult=img1Array+img2Array[mask]

<p>That could never work. You are saying 'add some of the pixels from img2Array to <em>all</em> of the pixels in img1Array' 6_9</p>

<h2>Question summary:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Can I get ghci to add filename completion to the <code>:so</code> command I defined in my <code>ghci.conf</code>?  </li>
<li>Could I somehow define a ghci command that returns code for compilation instead of returning a ghci command, or

file-extension-specific pre-processor, so <code>:l</code> would work for <code>.hs</code> and .lhs<code>files as usual, but use
my handwritten preprocessor for</code>.so` files?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>Haskell supports literate programming in <code>.lhs</code> source files, two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>LaTeX style <code>\begin{code}</code> and <code>\end{code}</code>.</li>
<li>Bird tracks: Code starts with <code>&gt;</code>, anything else is a comment.<br>
There must be a blank line between code and comments (to stop trivial accidental misuse of <code>&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't Bird tracks rules sound similar to StackOverflow's code blocks? </p>

<h2>The preprocessor</h2>

<p>I like writing SO answers in a text editor, and I like to make a post that consists of code that works, 
but end up with comment blocks or <code>&gt;</code>s that I have to edit out before posting, which is less fun.</p>

<p>So, I wrote myself a pre-processor.</p>

<ul>
<li>If I've pasted some ghci stuff in as a code block, it usually starts with <code>*</code> or <code>:</code>. </li>
<li>If the line is completely blank, I don't want it treated as code, because otherwise
I get accidental code-next-to-comment-line errors because I can't see the 4 spaces I accidentally 
left on an otherwise blank line.</li>
<li>If the preceeding line was not code, this line shouldn't be either, so we can cope with StackOverflow's 
use of indentation for text layout purposes outside code blocks. </li>
</ul>

<p>At first we don't know (dunno) whether this line is code or text:</p>

<pre><code>dunnoNow :: [String] -&gt; [String]
dunnoNow [] = []
dunnoNow (line:lines)
  | all (==' ') line = line:dunnoNow lines     -- next line could be either
  | otherwise = let (first4,therest) = splitAt 4 line in 
     if first4 /=""    ""                 -- 
        || null therest                 -- so the next line won't ever crash
        || head therest `elem` ""*:""     -- special chars that don't start lines of code.
     then line:knowNow False lines      -- this isn't code, so the next line isn't either
     else ('&gt;':line):knowNow True lines -- this is code, add &gt; and the next line has to be too
</code></pre>

<p>but if we know, we should keep in the same mode until we hit a blank line:</p>

<pre><code>knowNow :: Bool -&gt; [String] -&gt; [String]
knowNow _ [] = []
knowNow itsCode (line:lines) 
  | all (==' ') line = line:dunnoNow lines
  | otherwise = (if itsCode then '&gt;':line else line):knowNow itsCode lines
</code></pre>

<h2>Getting ghci to use the preprocessor</h2>

<p>Now we can take a module name, preprocess that file, and tell ghci to load it:</p>

<pre><code>loadso :: String -&gt; IO String
loadso fn = fmap (unlines.dunnoNow.lines) (readFile $ fn++"".so"") -- so2bird each line
        &gt;&gt;= writeFile (fn++""_so.lhs"")                     -- write to a new file
        &gt;&gt; return ("":def! rso (\\_ -&gt; return \"":so ""++ fn ++""\"")\n:load ""++fn++""_so.lhs"")
</code></pre>

<p>I've used silently redefining the <code>:rso</code> command becuase my previous attemts to use 
<code>let currentStackOverflowFile = ....</code> or <code>currentStackOverflowFile &lt;- return ...</code>
didn't get me anywhere.</p>

<h1>What to do to get it working</h1>

<p>Now I need to put it in my <code>ghci.conf</code> file, i.e. in <code>appdata/ghc/ghci.conf</code> 
as per the <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.2/html/users_guide/ghci-dot-files.html"">instructions</a></p>

<pre><code>:{
let dunnoNow [] = []
    dunnoNow (line:lines)
      | all (==' ') line = line:dunnoNow lines     -- next line could be either
      | otherwise = let (first4,therest) = splitAt 4 line in 
         if first4 /=""    ""                 -- 
            || null therest                 -- so the next line won't ever crash
            || head therest `elem` ""*:""     -- special chars that don't start lines of code.
         then line:knowNow False lines      -- this isn't code, so the next line isn't either
         else ('&gt;':line):knowNow True lines -- this is code, add &gt; and the next line has to be too
    knowNow _ [] = []
    knowNow itsCode (line:lines) 
      | all (==' ') line = line:dunnoNow lines
      | otherwise = (if itsCode then '&gt;':line else line):knowNow itsCode lines
    loadso fn = fmap (unlines.dunnoNow.lines) (readFile $ fn++"".so"") -- convert each line
        &gt;&gt;= writeFile (fn++""_so.lhs"")                            -- write to a new file
        &gt;&gt; return ("":def! rso (\\_ -&gt; return \"":so ""++ fn ++""\"")\n:load ""++fn++""_so.lhs"")
:}
:def so loadso
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Now I can save this entire post in <code>LiterateSo.so</code> and do lovely things in ghci like </p>

<pre><code>*Prelude&gt; :so StackOverflow
[1 of 1] Compiling StackOverflow    ( StackOverflow_so.lhs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: StackOverflow.

*StackOverflow&gt; :rso
[1 of 1] Compiling StackOverflow    ( StackOverflow_so.lhs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: StackOverflow.

*StackOverflow&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hooray!  </p>

<h1>What I would like:</h1>

<p>I would prefer to enable ghci to support this more directly. It would be nice to get rid of the intermediate <code>.lhs</code> file.</p>

<p>Also, it seems ghci does filename completion starting at the shortest substring of <code>:load</code> that determines 
you're actually doing <code>load</code>, so using <code>:lso</code> instead of <code>:so</code> doesn't fool it.</p>

<p>(I would <em>not</em> like to rewrite my code in C. I also would <em>not</em> like to recompile gchi from source.)</p>

<h2>Question reminder:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Can I get ghci to add filename completion to the <code>:so</code> command I defined in my <code>ghci.conf</code>?  </li>
<li>Could I somehow define a ghci command that returns code for compilation instead of returning a ghci command, or

12666739,"<p>Look carefully at your code. Your ViewController's ‘-play:‘ method creates a new GameController. Your GameController's ‘-init‘ creates a new ViewController. Is that really what you want?</p>

<p>You haven't given us much to go on, but it seems likely that either your game controller or your view controller should be ""in charge"" and create one instance of the other. There are about a million questions here on SO related to how to get one object to send some data to the another, but they all boil down to this: to pass information from object a to object b, a needs a pointer to b. A can then use that pointer to send messages to b.</p>

<p>So, for example, your view controller creates the game controller. That means the view controller has a pointer to the game controller, and it can use an instance variable or property to save that. If the game controller needs to send messages back to the view controller, it'll need a pointer to the view controller. The view controller can supply that pointer (to itself) when the game controller is created, or at some point afterward. To facilitate that, the game controller needs a method that can accept the pointer to the view controller. Maybe you decide to do it at creation, so you change the game controller's initialize toon method to ‘-initWithDelegate:(id)‘, define a GameControllerDelegate protocol, and then adopt that protocol in your ViewController class. You'd do this rather than just using ‘-initWithViewController:(ViewController*)‘ because its good style to prevent GameController from depending on the particular class of the object that's helping it -- GameController probably only cares that its helper implements a few methods, it doesn't need to know that it's helper is a ViewController.</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>The number of arguments is <code>$#</code>. Variables can be accessed indirectly via <code>${!VAR}</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ VAR=""PATH""
$ echo ${!VAR}
/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
</code></pre>

<p>Put those together and if we have a variable <code>$n</code> containing an integer we can access the <code>$n</code>th command-line argument with <code>${!n}</code>. Or instead of <code>$n</code> let's use <code>$#</code>; the last command-line argument is <code>${!#}</code>!</p>

<hr>

<p>Additionally, this can be more longwindedly written using array slicing (<code>$@</code> is an array holding all the command-line arguments) as:</p>

The paragraphs under the headings should display if they are hidden or hide if they are showing when the heading is clicked.  The directions for the assignment are in the HTML code.  I am about 90% there but I need help seeing what I am doing wrong.  This is a complete newbie script so I can't use anything that complicated (no innerHTML).  I need to be able to get to the parentNode of the h2 heading (which has a div tag) and use the parentNode to get to the paragraph children that are under the h2 headings.  So I am going to paste my HTML, CSS and JavaScript below.  One more final note, I can't alter the CSS or the HTML, the accordion has to work based on the JavaScript.

        &lt;hr /&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Create a simple accordion while implementing best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Change the part of the page heading to your name.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Add your name to the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; also.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Create and link to an external CSS.
          &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Create a class with a single declaration: &lt;em&gt;display:none;&lt;/em&gt; Name the class &lt;strong&gt;.hideContent&lt;/strong&gt;.  No class attribute should be added to the HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Create a second class with a single declaration: &lt;em&gt;display:block;&lt;/em&gt; Name the class &lt;strong&gt;.showContent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Create two more CSS rules. One should remove the bottom margin from all H2s. The other should remove the top margin from all paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Create and link to a JavaScript file.
          &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Create exactly two functions. One called &lt;strong&gt;preparePage()&lt;/strong&gt; that automatically applies the .hideContent style to all paragraphs within the accordion div and then makes the desired H2s call the second function when clicked. The second function,&lt;strong&gt;accordion()&lt;/strong&gt;, performs the class switching.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Make preparePage() run when the page loads.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;When an H2 inside the ""accordion"" div is clicked, the associated paragraph should change class so that it appears. If the paragraph is already visible, then it should disappear when its H2 is clicked.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;No inline JavaScript should appear in the HTML. Only a SCRIPT tag should be present in the HTML. No other JavaScript should be in the HTML anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Study the HTML first so you know the structure! Similar to backing up out of folders (like you did in NOS-110 using subdirectory markers) you will have to &amp;quot;back up&amp;quot; out of the H2 to get its parentNode. Then you can use that parentNode to descend back down to the child paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The only changes to this HTML file should be the addition of a &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; tag to link to your JS file, the addition of a &amp;lt;link&amp;gt; tag to link to your CSS, and the addition of your name to both the title and page heading.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is Lorem Ipsum?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/strong&gt; is simply dummy text of the printing and   typesetting industry..&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Why do we use it?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Where can I get some?&lt;/h2&gt;

<p>What's particularly notable about SQLite is that unlike all the others mentioned above, this database software doesn't come with a daemon that queries are passed through. This means that if multiple processes are using the database at once, they will be directly altering the data through the SQLite library and making the read / write data calls to the OS themselves. It also means that the locking mechanisms don't deal with contention very well.</p>

<p>This isn't a problem for most applications that where one would think of using SQLite -- the small overhead benefits and easy data retrieval are worth it. However, if you'll be accessing your database with more than one process or don't consider mapping all your requests through one thread, it could be slightly troublesome.</p>

<p>However, there's no guarantee that the function will always return a pointer to a valid object.

Then switch to a bitmap/bitboard representation much like how most modern chess engines function today. Then have a bitmap for each possible block type e.g. wall, empty, stairs, etc. The concept of a bitmap is to map the coordinates of the pieces of interest. Pieces on the map are given a boolean true value while unmapped coordinates will have a boolean false value. Then repeat this process for each block type.</p>

",1349067377,12667704,True,"<p>I seem to have a reasonable understanding of <code>volatiles</code> in general, but there's one seemingly obscure case, in which I'm not sure how things are supposed to work per the standard. I've read the relevant parts of C99 and a dozen or more related posts on SO, but can't find the logic in this case or a place where this case is explained.</p>

<p>Suppose we have this piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>  int a, c;
  volatile int b;
  a = b = 1;
  c = b += 1; /* or equivalently c = ++b; */
</code></pre>

<p>Should <code>a</code> be evaluated like this:</p>

<pre><code>  b = 1;
  a = b; // volatile is read
</code></pre>

<p>or like this:</p>

<pre><code>  b = 1;
  a = 1; // volatile isn't read
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Similarly, should <code>c</code> be evaluated like this:</p>

<pre><code>  int tmp = b;
  tmp++;
  b = tmp;
  c = b; // volatile is read
</code></pre>

<p>or like this:</p>

<pre><code>  int tmp = b;
  tmp++;
  b = tmp;
  c = tmp; // volatile isn't read
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>In simple cases like <code>a = b; c = b;</code> things are clear. But how about the ones above?</p>

<p>Basically, the question is, what exactly does ""expression has the value of the left operand after the assignment"" mean in 6.5.16c3 of C99 when the object is volatile?:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An assignment operator stores a value in the object designated by the
      left operand. An assignment <strong><em>expression has the value of the left operand
      after the assignment</em></strong>, but is not an lvalue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does it imply an extra read of the volatile to produce the value of the assignment expression?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>So, here's the dilemma.</p>

<p>If ""the value of the object after the assignment"" is not obtained from the extra read of the volatile object, then the compiler makes the assumption that the volatile object <code>b</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is capable of holding an arbitrary <code>int</code> value that gets written into it, which it may not be (say, bit 0 is hardwired to 0, which is not an unusual thing with hardware registers, for which we are supposed to use volatiles)</li>
<li>cannot change between the point when the assigning write has occurred and the point when the expression value is obtained (and again it can be a problem with hardware registers)</li>
</ul>

<p>And because of all that, the expression value, if not obtained from the extra read of the volatile object, does not yield the value of the volatile object, which the standard claims should be the case.</p>

<p>Both of these assumptions don't seem to fit well with the nature of volatile objects.</p>

<p>If, OTOH, ""the value of the object after the assignment"" is obtained from the extra implied read of said volatile object, then the side effects of evaluating assignment expressions with volatile left operands depend on whether the expression value is used or not or are completely arbitrary, which would be an odd, unexpected and poorly documented behavior.</p>

<p>The TCE contains a <code>CancellationToken</code> that equals <code>CancellationToken.None</code>.</p>

For example, if you have a monkeyrunner script, and issued a command to launch calculator app, you can have a python subprocess monitoring adb logcat -b events output to determine whether calculator app has been launched or not.

<p>For web-browser this is simple, I can just use onProgressChaged() or onPageFinished(). But I am looking for a more general way which works for all applications. I think Instrumentation.waitForIdleSync() or Instrumentation.waitForIdle() might be my best bet here. </p>

12666934,"<p>In practice, I would lean towards having param tags only list what you <em>want</em> passed in.  However, for return tags, you really do need to list every type that could possibly be returned.  Here's why I differ on the two.</p>

<p>Since PHP is not strongly typed, even when you say ""only pass in an int"", your method does still need to make sure it is not passed something unexpected.  Just because the method code tries to handle receiving other types, you don't want your docs to tell your users ""sure, you can pass me a NULL, and I'll do something with it for you"".  You want your docs to say ""give me an int, period"".</p>

<p>When considering return values, your users really really really need to know every potential return type that could come back from your method, because they really need to cover their bases in their code to handle all the types that your method might return.</p>
",1349100395,12674873,False,"<p>I am confused about when to use the <code>null</code> as a type when describing variables with PHPDoc.  Are type hints supposed to describe hopes and expectations for external callers to anticipate and comply with, or are they supposed to document all possible types of the variable even if the hope is it will be one very specific type in practice?</p>

<p>Example 1: default values.  The following function only expects non-null values.  But if no value is passed, it defaults to <code>null</code> and checks for that explicitly as a way to determine whether or not anything was passed, and returns a special value for that case.  Hopefully no external caller will pass anything except an integer.  Should <code>null</code> be used in the <code>@param</code> type as below, or should it only specify <code>int</code> since that's what we want passed if anything is passed?</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * @param int|null $bar
 */
function foo($bar = null) {
  if(is_null($bar)) { 
    return 'ABC';
  }

  return doSomething($bar);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Example 2: instance properties.  We only want $bar to contain integers.  That said, if nothing is set for bar then the default PHP value for this instance property is null.  Do I need to account for this every place that uses $bar, with a possible null type as below?</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  /**
   * @var int|null
   */
  public $bar;

  /**
   * @param int|null $bar
   */
  public setBar( $bar) {

  }

  /**
   * @return int|null
   */
  public function getBar() {
    return $this-&gt;bar;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically I find myself littering nearly every <code>@param</code> and <code>@var</code> declaration with <code>|null</code> because technically it could be that value.  But in practice it <em>shouldn't</em> be.  Should I expect nearly all of my types to contain the possibility of <code>null</code> or should that be assumed, and I should avoid specifying it unless I expect to set or receive a value of <code>null</code> explicitly?</p>

<p>I'm working on a problem in some C++ code that has a base class <code>InputFile</code>, and a number of derived classes: <code>TxtInputFile</code>, <code>ASCInputFile</code>, etc, where each derived class is a specific input type. </p>

<p>What I'd like to be able to do is to take a variable off the command line, and then generate the correct derived class object to deal with the indicated file type (e.g. user indicated <code>TXT</code> off the command line, so, I generate a <code>TXTInputFile</code> object and return under the <code>InputFile</code> label for use in the rest of the program). </p>

<p>I could do this with a string of <code>IF</code> / 'ELSE` statements, comparing the user-input with a bunch of predetermined file codes, but I'd like to be able to add support for new file types in the future without editing a string of if statements and adding new file codes, etc. </p>

<p>Is there any way to get access to some compiler generated table of all derived classes to a base class at runtime? </p>

<p>Or perhaps some sort of polymorphic constructor that is dynamically bound based on what the passed parameter is equal to? </p>

<p>(e.g. <code>InputFile(string)</code>... <code>TXTInputFile(string temp = ""TXT"")</code>, <code>ASCInputFile(string temp = ASC"")</code>... I realize that's the format for default values to parameters, just trying to suggest where I was going with that train of thought.)</p>

<p>First, Dart doesn't have prototypes or prototypal inheritance, and instead uses classical inheritance. Rather than a prototype, objects have a class, and instead of a prototype chain, objects have an super classes.</p>

<p>So far I have used:</p>

<pre><code>//run method in ""getter threads""
public void run() {

    try {

    URL url = new URL(url_s); //url_s is given as a constructor argument

    //if I am correct then url.openStream will wait until we have the content
    InputStream stream = url.openStream();

    Request req = new Request(); //a class with two variables:
    req.html_stream = new InputSource(stream);
    req.source = stream;

    //this is a class variable (LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Request&gt;)
    blocking_queue.put(req);

    } catch  (Exception ex) {
    logger.info(""Getter thread died from an exeption"",ex);
    return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I then have consumer thread (java.lang.Thread) that takes these <code>InputSource</code>s and <code>InputStream</code>s and does:</p>

<pre><code>public void run() {
   while(running) {
        try {
            logger.info(""waiting for data to eat"");
            Request req = blocking_queue.take();

   }
}

12667008,"<p>All the 'excess' code you see is specific to debug builds (and generally gets optimized away for release builds) and allows you to perform something that you can't ordinarily do in release build.</p>

<p>Debug build code is such that it allows maximum independence in setting up breakpoints and changing/examining stack values during a debug session. Also the IL code should mimic the higher level code as far as possible so that every 'cause' and 'effect' can be mapped to higher level code lines.</p>

<p>Now to be specific to your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the purpose of the nop operations in the original?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOP allows you to set breakpoints at places which are not 'executed'. For e.g. the opening braces of a method, loop or if statement. Among these non-executable instructions, breaking at the opening brace allows you to modify/examine stack just before a block starts (though admittedly you can achieve this very easily by breaking at the first line of execution of the block instead of opening brace but it still allows you independence of breaking at the opening brace)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the purpose of the br.s at the end of the methods in the original?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the original code, you might find it to be nonsensical to 'jump' to the next line instead of allowing the code to naturally 'fall' to the next line. But read it as:</p>

<p>""In a debug build, whenever a method needs to return, jump to the end of the method, read the return value from stack and then return the value""</p>

<p>So what advantage does it offer to debugging?</p>

<p>If you have more than one return statement in your code, both of them will 'jump' to the end of the code before reading the return value from stack. This allows you exactly one place (the closing brace of the method) where you can put a break-point and modify the return value before it is actually returned to the calling method. Pretty helpful isn't it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem is that you get SIGINT in your child process.
Try to add a handler for SIGINT in the child, then run your test.</p>

<p>You can see what happens with your current implementation after you pressed ctrl-c:</p>

<pre><code>serge    7685  7035 99 08:01 pts/3    00:00:08 ./a.out 1

</code></pre>

<p>Your child process got SIGINT and terminated. Also, it is necessary to handle the SIGCLD in the parent to get rid of all your children processes in a defunct state:</p>

<pre><code>if (sig == SIGCLD)
{
   // harvest terminated DEFUNCT child process
   pid = waitpid(-1, &amp;status, WNOHANG);
}

In any of those buffers, when one does anything, it immediately scrolls the buffer up so that there are 8 lines between the bottom of the buffer and the input line, making it awkward at best, unusable at worst, to use any terminal-like buffer in emacs, depending on the situation.</p>

Then my shell buffers are awkward or unusable because it immediately scrolls up 8 spaces whenever they get focus or display output from a command.</p>

12667052,"<p>Your problem is not with <code>at()</code>.  Your problem is that you're storing away an address to a local variable, and then later you're using that pointer, even though the local variable doesn't exist anymore.</p>

<p>Specifically, in <code>loadInventory</code>, here's one example:</p>

<pre><code> if (line.compare(""Paperback"") == 0) {
                ty = ""Paperback"";
                getline(ifs, line);
                ti = line;
                getline(ifs, line);
                au = line;
                getline(ifs, line);
                pri = line;
                Paperback p(ty, ti, au, pri);
                inventory.push_back(&amp;p);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Note in the second-to-last line how you create a local (stack) variable named ""p"".  In the last line, you take the address of that local variable and store it away.  Once the code hits that final brace in the above quote, the variable named ""p"" goes away, and that pointer in your vector is no good anymore.</p>

<p>One possible solution is to dynamically allocate:</p>

<pre><code>Paperback* p = new Paperback(ty, ti, au, pri);
inventory.push_back(p);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you do this, you'll have to delete those pointers yourself once your <code>inventory</code> vector is done with them.</p>

12667071,"<p>(I'm replying to the question before the edit, because I don't understand exactly what you meant in it).</p>

<p><code>socket.recv</code> is not the best way to wait for data on a socket. The best way I know is to use the <code>select</code> module (documentation <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/select.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). The simplest use when waiting for data on a single socket would be <code>select.select([your_socket],[],[])</code>, but it can certainly be used for more complex tasks as well.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of <code>socket.recv</code> receives an empty string; When the socket is a TCP socket (as it is in your case), this means the socket has been closed by the peer.
Reasons for this may vary, but the important thing to understand is that <strong>after this happens, you will no longer receive any data from this socket</strong>, so the best thing you can do with it is close it (<code>socket.close</code>). If you don't expect it to close, this is where you should search for the problem.</p>

<p>the <code>load_job</code> function sends the data with <code>socket.sendall</code> and right after that, it uses <code>socket.recv</code> (The data takes a long time to arrive).</p>

<p>The program runs fine until about 200 or 300 of theses jobs run. When it breaks, the <code>socket.recv</code> receives an empty string and cannot run any more jobs until I kill the node processes and run them again.</p>

<p><strong>How should I wait for the data to come?</strong> Also, error handling in <code>pool</code> is very poor because it saves the error from another process and show without the proper traceback and this error is not so common to repeat...</p>

Now I think this problem has nothing to do with sockets:</p>

12667111,"<p>I don't think that there is limit on practical value of lambda. You chose what works best for your problem and stick to it. For example if you have too many features and too little data then model will tend to overfit, you'd have to fight it with greater lambda (better thing to do would be get more data or remove some features). On the other hand if you have lots of data with relatively small number of features overfitting will not be such a big issue and lambda can be smaller.</p>

<p>One way to chose Lambda is to train your model with values of lambda [A .. B] (where A>0, B>A) and then plot cost function on cross validation set. It will be close to a convex curve, lambda corresponding to the global minima will be the optimal one.</p>

<p>What is the benefits having a property with a prefixed underscore??
What the heck does the underscore stands for??</p>

<p>Example ..</p>

<pre><code> var obj = {};  
obj.property = ""property value"";
obj._property = ""property value with _"";

alert( obj._property );
alert( obj.property );
</code></pre>

<p>When does the obj._property is more appropriate use than obj.property??</p>

<p>However, this is perfectly valid in HTML:</p>

<li>Don't create classes that has a similar name that classes in the Java API. For example, your <code>Date</code> class can easily be misunderstood with <code>java.util.Date</code>.</li>
<li>Don't use the <code>Vector</code> class, instead use <code>List&lt;YourClass&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;YourClass&gt;()</code>.

<li>Try to use public constructors for your classes. In your case, your program will compile and run just because all your classes are in the same package, but if they were in different packages, there will be a problem because almost all the constructors has the <code>default</code> visibility and can only be seen by classes of the same package. Take note about it: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Controlling Access to Members of a Class</a></li>
<li><code>FoodGroup</code> is not a parent class, it is a ""has-a"" relationship between 1) <code>FoodGroup</code> and <code>Date</code>, 2) <code>FoodGroup</code> and <code>Location</code>. It could be seen as a controller who <em>controls</em> the behavior and live of both classes instances.</li>
<li>When you post code here or other sites, <strong>please</strong> post a <a href=""http://sscce.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SSCCE</a> instead of your whole code. In that way, it will be easier for anyone to help you.</li>

12667149,"<p>You're rebinding the click event every single time the popup opens, so each time you click the close button it'll fire it multiple times which will cause unexpected behaviour.</p>

<p>Eg:</p>

<pre><code>var Popup = function(){
    $('#ok-button').live('click',function(){
        $('#popup').remove();
    });                
};
</code></pre>

<p>This code means every time you create a new Popup instance, every single $('#ok-button') that exists will have another click event bound to it.</p>

<p>As for the reason why it immediately closes when you use keydown vs keypress, that's due to the fact that the moment the popup is opened you've set the focus to the button. </p>

<p>The two key events work differently (firing at slightly different times during the key process). It appears that with keydown, you're changing the focus in the middle of the actual action (pressing the button on the keyboard) which then continues and triggers the focused click.</p>

<p>Removing the focus stops the weird double trigger behaviour because you're no longer binding another click event.</p>

<p>I'd suggest changing your click event:</p>

<pre><code>$('#ok-button').live('click', function(){
    $('#popup').remove();
}); 
var Popup = function(){
    // Whatever               
};

<p><strong>Binding 'keypress'</strong></p>

<p>Things work properly, with first enter key fires up a popup box and another enter key to dismiss the popup box.</p>

12667153,"<p>It all depends on how you're going to define the processing model. Here are some things you need to consider first.</p>

<p>An <code>any</code> particle can't be constrained with a type. It comes with an attribute named <code>processContents</code> that could be <strong>skip</strong>, <strong>lax</strong>, and the default, <strong>strict</strong>. Once you understand exactly what it means, then going with <strong><em>skip</em></strong> simply means that you will not be able to enforce your mandatory attribute - the processor will do just that, ""skip"". If you set it <strong><em>lax</em></strong>, then it will process it <strong>only if</strong> the XSD describing the content is actually available, otherwise it'll skip; The third option <strong><em>strict</em></strong>, requires the XSD describing this extra content to be available - period.</p>

<p>So the <code>any</code> particle can be made to work only if the XSD describing the ""any"" is available during validation. The option I have in mind is kind of limiting, but it has the advantage of being the closest to the ""spirit"" of an any in that it wouldn't have to derive from a particular base type, or reference some atttributes; for this, a key constraint similar to would approximate your requirement:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;xsd:key name=""ofid""&gt;
        &lt;xsd:selector xpath=""*""/&gt;
        &lt;xsd:field xpath=""@id""/&gt;
    &lt;/xsd:key&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In effect, the key makes the attribute required. The downside may be that each value must be unique, too. Maybe with an attribute named <code>id</code> , it is expected;  if instead you wish to apply the pattern to something such as <code>age</code>, then it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>If you decide that having XSDs available at runtime is acceptable, then other alternatives may include use of abstract elements or elements with abstract types. The good thing is that it'll bring a more disciplined approach (you'll set the constraints clearly right from the beginning), and without placing uniqueness of values constraints. The downside could be that it creates coupling to another XSD which describes the ""contract"" - your mandatory attributes.</p>

<p>UPDATE: As per your comment, below is an alternative based on substitution groups. I tried to keep as much as possible your old XSD components names.</p>

<p><strong>Contract.xsd</strong>: This has the components of your contract. It basically describes the head of your substitution group; it indicates the need for an id attribute.</p>

",1349062310,12667204,True,"<p>I have a table being generated from PostgreSQL through PHP. </p>

<p>The user needs to have the option of deleting the row or updating it.</p>

<p>So I have successfully implemented a delete button utilizing hidden elements to pass the key information for the deletion to my delete.php</p>

<p>Now I am trying to add an update button which will send the php to my update.php rather than my delete.php.</p>

<p>However, when I open my form I tell it where to send the data upon submission.</p>

<p>My question then is, is there a way that I can have both buttons available and depending on which button is pressed the form posts the data to the appropriate php- delete.php vs update.php? Perhaps some attribute of input buttons I cannot think of that can direct where to POST rather than having it as a form attribute?</p>

<p>Basically each facility in the list of facilities there has properties for an ID, Name, Description that I can get out. I just want to be able to put a title attribute on each <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> that gets rendered and put the description into it. Either that or be able to add a custom attribute like 'data-description' to each <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> tag then I can add the title into each option tag myself using a bit of jQuery which is easy enough.</p>

<p>I miss the days where you could just loop through a list and output the custom dropdown code manually.</p>

It's really confusing to me - what would cause that string to sometimes be passed to the server instead of the object?</p>

The problem I have is that I can't split the css on this one as it parses also whole strings. The usage is like that: I've got a @username somewhere in the string. If the user hovers it a div with informations will get prepended to the current username. Now there is the problem that I've allowed users to post images in this text also. As the autolinker is flexible it doesn't know the image sizes and restrictions and I want to leave it like that! So I define css classes which look like that:</p>

<pre><code>.minpost img{ max-height: 30px; max-width: 30px; }

<p>so the <code>GameObject</code> might have a 3D coordinate of where it is in the GameWorld, and a 3D model of points and surfaces to draw on the screen, and so forth.</p>

<p>So we have this generic object first, and then we inherit more generic objects based on it, in this case, the <code>KartDriver</code> and the <code>WeaponObject</code>.</p>

<p>And even <code>Yoshi</code> might be a generic object, that if there are 8 players and 2 of them chose the same character (in an online race), then there will be 2 Yoshi objects, and Yoshi also became a generic object.</p>

<p>Or even the GameWorld object, might seem it is a concrete and unique object, but if the server hosts 30 races at the same time (with each race usually 5 to 8 people), there in fact there will be 30 GameWorld objects.</p>

<p>But on a 3DS console, the GameWorld would be just 1 object, so in this case it is not a generic object, or maybe we can say it is a generic object, but there will be a singleton object based on it.</p>

<p>Is it true that the typical Javascript Prototypal Inheritance pattern will usually be like this?  It might be extremely rare that it is purely based on ""concrete object"" inheritance?  If there are such usage, what might be the situation that a Javascript purely uses ""concrete objects"" and have no ""generic objects""?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I ask this question because Prototypal Inheritance typically is said to be ""classless"" and object-based.  But it also seems that we'd create  generic objects first, for the concrete objects to be based on, so this ""generic object"", in a way, also feel like a ""class"".  That is, even if we don't write code to make Javascript's inheritance to become a classical inheritance structure (class-based), and purely just use prototypal inheritance (object-based), we would still more often than not, use ""generic objects"" which do look like classes.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: if we see a class as a ""blueprint"" of how an object is constructed, in classical OOP, then this generic object method also involves blueprints for objects, but just that it is more dynamic and not static like Objective-C.  For example, we can dynamically add a property to <code>KartDriver</code> object and now all Yoshis and Marios will inherit from it.  So looking at this blueprint design, it in fact is ""class"" and not ""classless"".  Just that this is dynamic class, while the classical OOP is static class.</p>

I would like to enhance the audio quality. According to some knowledge from web, I found that When an <code>audio/music/sound</code> is played , the <code>AudioTrack</code> will <code>write()</code> PCM data to the sharedbuffer, and then <code>AudioFlinger</code> will <code>read()</code> the PCM data form this sharedbuffer.
The idea is to use a service to intercept the PCM data after it is wrote by <code>AudioTrack.write()</code>, modify the PCM data, and then restore it back to the sharedbuffer for <code>AudioFlinger</code> to <code>read()</code>;

<p>Updates.</p>

<p>I intend to read up to a million rows of data from Google's Data Store ( or maybe the new NDB ), and save the data into a text file for further processing either on Google Cloud Compute or some third party services like PiCloud.</p>

<p>The data is basically a network relationship and it goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>A -&gt; B
B -&gt; C
A -&gt; D
</code></pre>

<p>The above means that A is linked to B, B is linked to C and A is linked to D and so on...</p>

<p>As i have over a million edges, i think i might have to use the task queue or cron job to do this?</p>

<p>So after i processed the relationships, i'll have another text file which contains some scores between each pair of nodes, which i will than write back into the database.</p>

12672349,"<p>I did actually read the explanation of the ranking system and if I'm correct they do not care about the <em>current</em> time, but the <em>time of submission of the post</em>. This means the score will change on two points; 1) when the post is submitted, 2) when someone up- or downvotes the post</p>

12667275,"<p>Push is used when accessing variables during rendering. In your case you are setting the value in the textfield to empty, and since that is all you are doing inside the push it is clear that the push tag is not doing anything useful.  </p>

<p>What I think you might be intending is to ""push"" student in the view, what would be the equivalent of appending ""student."" to all the variables. This is not what the push tag does, although I must admit such a tag would be useful and possibly save a lot of typing. We can see that the target of the action implements model driven (and the model is a Student), this effectively pushes the student to the top of the stack already, so simply remove the push tag and you should be good.</p>

<p>The following is advice:</p>

<p>Your action has a get/set Student... it should not if it implements ModelDriven. </p>

<p>Your class StudentAction, should probably be called AddStudentAction.</p>

<p>The addStudent method should be removed and the functionality moved into execute() ie:</p>

<pre><code>public String execute() throws Exception {
    student.setCreatedDate(new Date());
    studentService.add(student);
    return SUCCESS;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should implement a validate method <code>public void validate()</code> (unless you're doing that in xml or annotations).  </p>

<p>Finally, this is personal preference but when you implement ModelDriven it helps to supply the type ie: <code>implements ModelDriven&lt;Student&gt;</code> (Then the IDE hopefully knows to create the correct getter/setter). </p>

<p>In short, I am building an application that will have several subdomains, and I would like a different configuraton for all of them, while sharing multiple bundles from /src, and more importantly, import central config and routes (As well as each app's own)</p>

<p>I'm pretty much at the stage where it appears this simply is not possible. Which I find really strange for a system as touted as Symfony, especially when it appears Symfony1.4 did this rather easily.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your responses. The challenge is, there is a hierarchy of configs. These configs in turn import their own routing.yml files.</p>

<p>For instance: the domain <a href=""http://testing.api.mydomain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://testing.api.mydomain.com</a> would include the following configs:</p>

<p>config_api.yml -> config_testing.yml -> config_dev.yml -> config.yml</p>

<p>All import their own routing.yml file. But only the one in config_api.yml is loaded. It seems framework: router: config option overrides previous usages in other config files, rather than extends. </p>

<p>In all fairness, the location of the app code is inconsequential. Having a hierarchical configuration with hierarchical routes seems to be the gotacha. </p>

12667293,"<p>At the risk of being downvoted, I'm going to provide a very crude, somewhat subjective hypothesis.</p>

<p>QT, while being very general-purpose, doesn't exactly provide a blazing fast GUI API. Its level of abstraction has quite a cost. We're talking about a heap allocation per widget, per layout, etc. Just have a look at QListWidget and the fact that QListWidgetItem in itself is a separately allocated, fairly complex object. I once had to profile a developer's code -- the logic was suspected to be slow, but I found that almost the entire 6 seconds it took for the operation was spent creating a QListWidget with thousands of list entries. This was in C++.</p>

<p>My thoughts on this, without seeing your code and usage of QT, is that the overall overhead of the QT GUI makes the differences between a language like C++ and Python negligible.</p>

<p>Now what isn't so debatable is that the productivity of using QT through Python is dramatically greater than using it in C++ where we have to deal with the MOC with preprocessed signals and slots, etc. You might want to focus on that more than the performance differences of using a GUI framework in one language vs another.</p>

I will say there are specific concepts that are used through all the framework, such as the concept of signal (in short, the event raised from a widget), and slot (in short, the method called when the event is raised), which allows you to change what shown from a widget basing on the value of other widgets.</p>

<p>Those items can/should be passed to allocator function, which then technically is a ""placement new"", although here it will <em>not construct in-place</em>: it's a <strong>placement new</strong> merely because it has extra, user-defined arguments, like this:</p>

<pre><code>bool hopefully( bool const c ) { return c; }

template&lt; class X &gt;
bool throw_( X const&amp; x ) { throw x; }

void* operator new( size_t const size, char const* const filename, int const linenum )
{
    void* const p = tracked_allocate( &amp;memory_context, size, filename, linenum );
    hopefully( p != 0 )
        || throw_( std::bad_alloc() )
    return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to define a corresponding placement deallocation function, or else a <code>new</code> expression will fail to deallocate when a constructor throws:</p>

<pre><code>void operator delete( void* const p )
{
    // Your custom deallocation.
}

void operator delete( void* const p, char const*, int )
{
    ::operator delete( p );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now your macro just needs to provide the relevant placement arguments, like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define SOURCE_LINE_INFO __FILE__, __LINE__
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can just say, like,</p>

<pre><code>new (SOURCE_LINE_INFO) MyType( arg1, arg2, arg3 )
</code></pre>

<p>For a more reusable solution consider defining a <code>struct</code> to hold the filename and line number. Then the macro reduces to constructing an instance of that type, and can be used more generally. In particular, it can then be used for logging calls.</p>
",1349064794,12667465,True,"<p>In order to do some custom memory tracking (leak prevention, corruption detection), I'm having to use placement new to create C++ objects, which works fine - but I'm struggling to figure out how I can pass arguments to the constructor, since it's called from a macro (so the file + line can be provided automatically).</p>

<p>The function:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
T*
cpp_new(
    const char *file,
    size_t line
)
{
    T   *n = (T*)tracked_allocate(&amp;memory_context, sizeof(T), file, line);

    if ( n )
    {
        construct(n);
    }
    else
    {
        throw std::bad_alloc();
    }

    return n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is called via the macro:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
void
construct(
    T *obj
)
{
    obj = new (obj) T;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The va_list macros would cover the expansion for the variable number of arguments, only I don't want to supply the number of arguments the constructor has, removing va_arg(), and can't use va_start(), since it expects a format.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can use <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> from new_object and pass them into the construct function? Each object only has one constructor, but there are many different types of objects taking different parameters, so I want to remove as much manual maintenance as possible.</p>

12667394,"<p>Chris Jester-Young's comment is correct: don't use R5RS.  In the standard R5RS language, there's no such thing as a module.

<p>Racket takes the standard more seriously than you'd expect: if you tell it to work in R5RS mode, it will turn <strong>off</strong> language features that the standard does not describe.</p>

<p>If you're using the Racket toolchain, don't use the R5RS language unless you really want to work in a restrictive language.  Use standard <em>#lang racket</em> instead.

<p>The main navigation is something like this:</p>

<p>Home | First Group | Some page | Another page | Second Group | Yet another page</p>

<p>When the user clicks Home, Some page, Yet another page, it is taken directly to that page. </p>

<p>If the user clicks any of the ""groups"" it is taken to the ""default page"" for that group, and a submenu which is implemented as a menu widget is shown in the before content area. The first group can have 5 pages</p>

<p>Page 1.1 | Page 1.2 | Page 1.3 | Page 1.4 | etc.</p>

<p>The Second Group will have another set of pages. </p>

/group-2/page-1-3

  <p>The manager module will control and load both these modules (.so) into memory. If one was to fail. The manager could try and re-load it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is usually a bad idea if it's in a single C process - if one of these modules fail, you're unlikely to be able to safely unload it, much less load it again. If you need to be able to recover from module failure, you must use independent processes. The code can still be in an .so file though - just <code>fork()</code> the manager once for each module to load; this is the model used by the chrome plugins API, for example.</p>

<p>Moreover, dealing with component failure can be very, very tricky in itself. Just because A restarts doesn't mean B is ready to talk to a newly restarted A. You may want to try to glean some ideas off <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/"">erlang</a>, which handles component failure exceptionally well by encouraging the decomposition of applications into message-passing subcomponents with a hierarchy of supervisor modules to restart failing components. This may be a bit overkill if you only have two modules, but it's something to think about at least.</p>

<p>As for how to communicate, there are a number of paradigms. If these modules are in the same process, you could just pass a vtable around. That is, for example:</p>

<pre><code>// moduleA.h

struct vtable_A {
  void (*do_something)();
};

void set_vtable_B(struct vtable_B *);
struct vtable_A *get_vtable_A();
void start_A();

// moduleB.h
struct vtable_B {
  void (*do_something)();
};

void set_vtable_A(struct vtable_A *);
struct vtable_B *get_vtable_B();
void start_B();
</code></pre>

<p>Your manager would load both, pass the vtable from A to B and vice versa, and thereafter call the start routines. Be careful with ordering - either A must be started before B is ready, or vice versa, and they need to be okay with this.</p>

<p>If they're in independent processes, message passing is usually the way to go. It's essentially a network protocol at that point - your subprocesses will send serialized messages to the manager, and the manager routes them to other subprocesses. The conversation might look a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>MGR-&gt;A      START
MGR-&gt;B      START
A-&gt;MGR      REGISTER_ENDPOINT 'ProcessA'
A-&gt;MGR      WATCH_ENDPOINT 'ProcessB'
MGR-&gt;A      OK_REGISTER 'ProcessA'
MGR-&gt;A      OK_WATCH 'ProcessB'
B-&gt;MGR      REGISTER_ENDPOINT 'ProcessB'
B-&gt;MGR      WATCH_ENDPOINT 'ProcessA'
MGR-&gt;B      OK_REGISTER 'ProcessB'
MGR-&gt;A      NEW_ENDPOINT 'ProcessB'
A-&gt;MGR      APPLICATION_DATA TO:'ProcessB', PAYLOAD:""Hello, world!""
MGR-&gt;B      OK_WATCH 'ProcessA'
MGR-&gt;B      NEW_ENDPOINT 'ProcessA'
MGR-&gt;B      APPLICATION_DATA FROM:'ProcessA', PAYLOAD:""Hello, world!""
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind, there are many other ways to structure this kind of protocol than the example above, and to build RPC on top of a message-passing protocol. You may be interested in looking at things such as <a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus"">DBUS</a> (which you may be able to use directly!) or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model"">DCOM</a>, which have done this sort of thing before. Other optimizations on top of this sort of protocol include using the manager to establish a direct channel of some sort between A and B, and getting it involved again only if A or B need to be restarted.</p>

<p>That said, don't get too deep into the details of how the manager works before you figure out what it needs to do. Design the plugin&lt;->manager <em>high level</em> interface, and plugin&lt;->plugin protocol; only then design the details of the plugin&lt;->manager interface. It's far too easy to get sidetracked and end up with something way too complex like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture"">CORBA</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP"">SOAP</a>.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am developing a large project that will contain 2 modules (shared libraries) that I will develop.</p>

<p>The modules are shared libraries created by me in C, that will have to sync and exchange messages between each other.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/unJAn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The manager module will control and load both these modules (.so) into memory. If one was to fail. The manager could try and re-load it.</p>

<p>I am wondering as this is my first time I have done something like this. Is there any design patterns that could be followed?</p>

<p>All this will be written in C and using the APR (Apache Portable Runtime) for memory pool management and maybe some threading pool if needed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start manager that will load both modules. </li>
<li>Manager then calls some functions on both of them maybe to start and stop them, and  possible cleanup. </li>
<li>Once both modules have been loaded and started. They should be able to exchange some messages between each other. </li>
</ol>

<p>The modules will all run on the same machine running Redhat.</p>

<p>Many thanks for any suggestions.</p>

Which i guess was due to the new features that were included in the new Xcode 4.5. So I was thinking is there a way to open project from new Xcode in the older version without having to install a new Xcode and OSX.</p>

<p>I am not sure if this question is asked here yet or not, but i tried to find a solution but no luck in that either.</p>

",1349066065,12667569,True,"<p>Before I start, I have to apologize for bringing up another case of permutations with duplicates. I have gone through most of the search results and can't really find what I am looking for. I have read about the Lexicographical order and have implemented it. For this question, I am suppose to implement a recursion method that prints out the all the strings of length n consisting of just the characters a and b that have an equal number of a and b’s. The strings must be printed out one line at a time in lexical order. So, for example, a call:</p>

<pre><code>printBalanced(4);
</code></pre>

<p>will print the strings:</p>

<pre><code>aabb
abab
abba
baab
baba
bbaa

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){
    printBalanced(4);
}

    String letters = """";

    //string to be duplicates of ""ab"" depending the number of times the user wants it

<p>As you can see, I get a lot of duplicates. This is partly due to the requirement to use only characters 'a' and 'b'. The duplicates will not happen if it was ""abcd"" or ""0123"". I have read about using an arraylist and store all the results and then loop through N elements to check for duplicates and then removing it. This does not seem to be the best way to do it.

<p>I am suppose to write the code that will store the collection into a file and the likewise right the code that will load the file and read from it.</p>

<p>Thanks to a fairly helpful TA I was able to formulate the following code for each</p>

<pre><code>void store()
{
FILE * fileName;
fileName = fopen ( ""Ranking.dbm"" , ""wb"" );
fwrite ( Collection, sizeof(struct YouTubeVideo), MAX, fileName);

fclose (fileName);
                    }
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>void read()
{
FILE *fileName;
fileName = fopen(""ranking.dbm"", ""rb"");
if (fileName != NULL){
    fread ( Collection, sizeof(struct YouTubeVideo), MAX, fileName);
}
else {
    printf(""ERROR"");
                        }   

                    }
</code></pre>

<p>I believe these each to function but the real problem is I don't think I quite understand how and I believe that since I dont even know how they function, I dont know how to use them in the code.</p>

<p>I added both methods to the given code and came up with this:</p>

<p>Now I am sure anyone who has read this has probably already face palmed themselves cause they see the problem, but I do not. The code does not create the file to write to and likewise it has nothing to read from so I cant even begin to see what is wrong with that.
 Now I am not looking for a given answer, but I would really like to know what it is I am doing incorrectly, what concepts I appear to not understand, and how I can go about fixing these. I have done a few hours of research on this already and  I realize it is elementary, but I really would like a hand in learning. Its frustrating spending hours on a topic that the professor said should only take a couple of hours to complete at most.</p>

",1349116003,12678874,True,"<p>I want to revise my usage of the visitor pattern for tree-structures and different node types. Every node in the tree-structure has to implement a callback method and the visitor implementation must implement something like the following for each node type (or at least the types he's interested in):</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * Do something when visiting a {@link CommentNode}.
 * 
 * @param pNode

 *          the {@link ElementNode}
 */
EVisitResult visit(final @Nonnull ElementNode pNode);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using transactional cursor semantics to navigate through the tree-structure and provide an acceptVisitor-method, that is in the cursor I've implemented the following:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public EVisitResult acceptVisitor(final @Nonnull IVisitor pVisitor) {
  assertNotClosed();
  return mCurrentNode.acceptVisitor(pVisitor);
}
</code></pre>

<p>However the visitor is a flaw in the API, because exposing the nodes itself, for instance <code>ElementNode</code> is very dangerous, because modifications which are allowed for every node-type should only be able from within a specific write-transaction (implemented as a cursor which provides methods to traverse a tree-structure). Otherwise the changes are not visible and not made persistent during a <code>commit()</code>.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to circumvent this situation? I somehow doubt I'm able to provide the visitor-interface as method signatures for sure have to be different...</p>

<p>Ok, I will provide Immutable ""wrapper"" or proxy classes:</p>

/**

<p>However, the fundamental problem here is that a URL with a space character in the query part is not a legal URL ... not withstanding that a typical web browser will accept it.  The exception is therefore correct.</p>

<p>Your example URLs seem to show that the space is escaped with a '+'.  This is HTML form escaping not proper URL escaping.  You seem to be saying that you get the same result is you use <code>%20</code> ... which would be correct escaping.</p>

But why does it selectively exclude the height of the tab bar but NOT the height of the status bar??? Apple's View Programming Guide doesn't not seem to explain that... but let's move on...</p>

12667693,"<p>If you're going to use the Lua API, you need to become comfortable with the Lua stack. And one of the most important things you can learn to do is understanding how to read <a href=""http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#lua_pcall"" rel=""nofollow"">the Lua API docs.</a> For every function, there is a notation on the right about exactly how it affects the stack (if it modifies the stack at all).</p>

<p><code>luaL_loadfile</code> loads a file and pushes that file as a Lua function onto the stack. <code>lua_pcall</code> executes a function on the stack. But it has a number of caveats about how it does stuff.</p>

<p>The way calling functions through Lua works in terms of the stack is simple. You push the function you want to call. Then you push all of the arguments, in order, from first to last. Then you issue your call of that function. <code>lua_pcall</code> works in this way. This means that the location of the function to execute is <em>always</em> <code>nargs + 1</code>, relative to the top of the stack, where <code>nargs</code> is the number of arguments you're passing to the function.</p>

<p>Note that <code>lua_pcall</code> will <em>pop the function from the stack</em> (along with all of the arguments). If you just loaded the file, this will be the <em>only reference</em> to that function in Lua. Thus, you will not be able to execute the file again. You should duplicate the function before pushing its arguments onto the stack, using <a href=""http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#lua_pushvalue"" rel=""nofollow""><code>lua_pushvalue</code> to copy it</a>. You should probably stick it in the <code>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</code> table or something, so that it's value is preserved.</p>

<p>You need to evaluate the following, or a minor variant on it using <code>&lt;=</code> instead of <code>&lt;</code>, perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>Start1 &lt; End2 AND Start2 &lt; End1
</code></pre>

<p>Since you're working with a single table, you need to have a self-join:</p>

  JOIN products p2
    ON p1.product_reg_no != p2.product_reg_no
   AND p1.start &lt; p2.end
   AND p2.start &lt; p1.end;
</code></pre>

<p>The not equal condition ensures that you don't get a record paired with itself (though the <code>&lt;</code> conditions also ensure that, but if you used <code>&lt;=</code>, the not equal condition would be a good idea.</p>

<p>This will generate two rows for each pair of products (one row with ProductA as <code>p1</code> and ProductB as <code>p2</code>, the other with ProductB as <code>p1</code> and ProductA as <code>p2</code>).  To prevent that happening, change the <code>!=</code> into either <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>And, looking more closely at the sample data, it might be that you're really interesting in rows where the registration numbers match and the dates overlap.  In which case, you can ignore my wittering about <code>!=</code> and <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> and replace the condition with <code>=</code> after all.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT p1.*, p2.*
  FROM products p1
  JOIN products p2

   AND p1.start &lt; p2.end
   AND p2.start &lt; p1.end;

 WHERE (p1.start_date != p2.start_date OR p1.end_date != p2.end_date);

<p>The WHERE clause eliminates the rows that are joined to themselves.  With the duplicate column names in the SELECT-list eliminated, you get to see all the data.  I added a row:</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I just wanted to add, instead of the .Body.RemoveFocus() you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>WB.Document.Body.Parent.RemoveFocus()
</code></pre>

<p>Which I prefer, since the .Document object didn't have an explicit .RemoveFocus method on the intellisense I was gettign in VS2012 RC. This is probably referring to the HTML tag (and not the .Document object) and since the <code>html</code> tag is the only parent to the <code>body</code> tag, it makes sense, and there is no ""HTML"" object directly available in the intellisense under object, since you can get it via other means, so it's just more convenient doing it this way.</p>

In particular, I'd like to do it without <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/climits/"" rel=""nofollow"">CHAR_BIT</a> or any other magic numbers.</p>

<p>I started with the following non-metaprogram:</p>

    int count = 0;

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:<br>
I am essentially looking for the metaprogram equivalent of the magic numbers in <code>&lt;climits&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;limits&gt;</code>.

12667843,"<p>You could try to implement a 'dictionary function': you call it with the geographic code you mention and it returns the localized content you want to embed in the html template. In background it consults a 'catalog', that typically is an array structure like this: </p>

<pre><code>$LCat = array (
  'India' =&gt; array (
    'Assam' =&gt; array (
      'Dispur' =&gt; ""some Dispur specific content"",
      'Guwahati' =&gt; ""some Guwahati specific content"",
      ... some other cities in that state ...
    ),
    'Orissa' =&gt; array (
      'Bhubaneswar' =&gt; ""some Bhubaneswar specific content"",
      ... some other cities in that state ...
    ),
    ... some other states in that country ...
  ),
  ... some other countries ...
);
</code></pre>

<p>The function looks for a matchin entry in the catalog (e.g. by using the is_set() function): </p>

<pre><code>if ( is_set($LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']]) ) {
  if ( is_set($LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']['state_code']]) )
    if ( is_set($LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']['state_code']['city_code']]) ) ) {
      $Location=$LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']['state_code']]['city_code']];
    } else {
      $Location=$LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']['state_code']]
  } else {
    $Location=$LCat[$_SESSION['smart_ip']['location']['country_code']]
} else {
  $Location=""location specific content for 'Nirwana'"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the structure is: state > country > city, or whatever structure you require. The idea is: try to use the most specific match in the catalog. If it is not present, then use the entry a little less specific and so on. This way you always have a safe fallback coded in the structure instead of having to code fallbacks for every location your script might stumble upon. </p>

<p>Obviously the content stored for a match can be anything, I only chose simple strings to make the point. Also the structure could be stored in a different way, for example in a file system hierarchy you examine at runtime, a folder for each country, in that a folder for each state, in there files for each city or the like. If you want to improve performance and offer an easy way to manage the catalog data then you sould store that catalog in a database which you query at runtime. The idea remains the same, though. </p>

<p>Note that I have not tested that code, but it should give you a suggestion of a possible approach. </p>

Since instead of subtracting <code>n</code>, you're adding a large number, the carry flag needs to be handled differently. That extra <code>1</code> would usually signify a carry in bitwise addition, whereas here it signifies that everything worked out right. If there wasn't a carry there, it actually means that the result should have been negative - <code>a - b</code> was converted to <code>a + 2^n - b</code> which was less than <code>2^n</code>, meaning that <code>b &gt; a</code> and so <code>a - b &lt; 0</code>.

12667868,"<h1>What is Hadoop?</h1>

<p>Imagine the following challange: you have a lot of data, and with a lot I mean at least Terabytes. You want to transform this data or extract some informations and process it into a format which is indexed, compressed or ""digested"" in a way so you can work with it.</p>

<p>Hadoop is able to parallelize such a processing job and, here comes the best part, takes care of things like redundant storage of the files, distribution of the task over different machines on the cluster etc (Yes, you need a cluster, otherwise Hadoop is not able to compensate the performance loss of the framework).</p>

<p>If you take a first look at the Hadoop ecosystem you will find 3 big terms: HDFS(Hadoop Filesystem) Hadop itself(with MapReduce) and HBase(the ""database"" sometimes column store, which does not fits exactly)</p>

<p>HDFS is the Filesystem used by both Hadoop and HBase. It is a extra layer on top of the regular filesystem on your hosts. HDFS slices the uploaded Files in chunks (usually 64MB) and keeps them available in the cluster and takes care of their replication.</p>

<p>When Hadoop gets a task to execute, it gets the path of the input files on the HDFS, the desired output path, a Mapper and a Reducer Class. The Mapper and Reducer is usually a Java class passed in a JAR file.(But with <a href=""http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.15.2/streaming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadoop Streaming</a> you can use any comandline tool you want). The mapper is called to process every entry (usually by line, e.g.: ""return 1 if the line contains a bad F* word"") of the input files, the output gets passed to the reducer, which merges the single outputs into a desired other format (e.g: addition of numbers). This is a easy way to get a ""bad word"" counter.</p>

<p>The cool thing: the computation of the mapping is done on the node: you process the chunks linearly and you move just the semi-digested (usually smaller) data over the network to the reducers.</p>

<p>And if one of the nodes dies: there is another one with the same data.</p>

<p>HBase takes advantage of the distributed storage of the files and stores its tables, splitted up in chunks on the cluster. HBase gives, contrary to Hadoop, random access to the data.</p>

<p>As you see HBase and Hadoop are quite different to RDMBS. Also HBase is lacking of a lot of concepts of RDBMS. Modeling data with triggers, preparedstatements, foregian keys etc. is not the thing HBase was thought to do (I'm not 100% sure about this, so correct me ;-) )</p>

<h1>can Django integrated with Hadoop?</h1>

<p>For Java it's easy: Hadoop is written in Java and all the API's are there, ready to use.</p>

<p>For Python/Django I don't know (yet), but I'm sure you can do something with Hadoop streaming/Jython as a last resort.
I've found the following: <a href=""http://www.hadoopy.com/en/latest/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadoopy</a> and <a href=""http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/writing-an-hadoop-mapreduce-program-in-python/"" rel=""nofollow"">Python in Mappers and Reducers</a>.</p>
",1349088755,12671891,True,"<p>From what I understood, Hadoop is a distributed storage system thingy. However what I don't really get is, can we replace normal RDBMS(MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle) with Hadoop? Or is Hadoop is just another type of filesystem and we CAN run RDBMS on it?</p>

<p>Also, can Django integrated with Hadoop? Usually, how web frameworks (ASP.NET, PHP, Java(JSP,JSF, etc) ) integrate themselves with Hadoop?</p>

<p>Depending on what you need, most likely either 1 or 3 are going to be best. If you plan on reusing the object for other methods than just the one function, then option 1 is the best, but if you just need the 1 function, go with option 3 like this:</p>

12667918,"<p>While using TCP sockets will do the job, it's not a good idea as you would have to take care of a LOT of stuff, like message formatting, streaming, etc. Use one of the already available messaging protocols and libraries.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">XMPP</a>, which has a set of open standards for implementing messaging between devices. An advantage is that there are plenty of libraries available for implementing both XMPP clients and servers.</p>

<p>For implementing an XMPP client on Android devices, you can use a library called <a href=""http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/"" rel=""nofollow"">Smack</a>. It is actually a Java based library. I have implemented a Facebook XMPP chat client using <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/asmack/"" rel=""nofollow"">Asmack</a>, which is a Android port of Smack. The Smack documentation is applicable to Asmack as well. However, Asmack hasn't been updated for two years and has some issues and I've been thinking of changing my client to Smack to see if the new version plays nice with Android.</p>

<p>As for implementing an XMPP server, you can check out <a href=""http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">Openfire</a>, made by the same guys who made Smack. I have not used this yet, but the project page has extensive documentation on setting up Openfire. Judging by the quality of the Smack library which I used, I daresay Openfire will work pretty well.</p>

<p>The meaning of an <code>alt</code> attribute (not tag) is that it specifies an alternative, a substitute for the image, in situations where the image is not displayed. So if you want to hide it when the image has not yet been loaded, you are asking for behavior that contradicts the very meaning of the attribute.</p>

<p>You can however make the <code>alt</code> text invisible (with the usual CSS Caveats) on Firefox by setting e.g.</p>

12667929,"<p>Usually, if you have a fk in your table, you'll have a relationship in your entity. If you don't have it, you should add it.</p>

<p>The best approach is to create a ViewModel class for what you want to show from both entities:</p>

<pre><code>public class OrderViewModel {
    public string CustomerName{ get; set; }
    public decimal OrderTotal { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you need to execute a query that retrieves all the information:</p>

<pre><code>var query = from o in dataContext.Orders
            select new ViewModel {
                                   CustomerName = o.Customer.Name,                                                            
                                   OrderTotal = o.Total,
                                   Date = o.Date
                                 };
</code></pre>

<p>and use it as the data source for the Grid.</p>

<p>If by any chances you don't have the relationship in your model, you can do a less straight forward query:</p>

<pre><code>var query = from o in dataContext.Orders
            join c in dataContext.Customers on o.CustomerId equals c.Id

<p>So for Android, for OnClickListeners, OnTouchListeners, etc., you're allowed to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>    bio.setOnCancelListener(new OnCancelListener() {

12668003,"<p>I think this is a g++ bug with default member initialization. I'm not positive about this, and so have the following supporting evidence:</p>

<p>Personally, I think default member initialization should be used sparingly and with care. I think it's really easy to create a lot of confusion with it because most people expect all the initialization to be done in the constructor, and member initializers are not necessarily anywhere near any constructor. So they can leave someone scratching their head wondering how some member gets a particular value.</p>

<p>I can see cases, especially with simple, mostly-data classes for which it would work pretty well. But mostly, I think if you have a constructor body of any kind, you should probably not be using default member initialization.</p>

12668038,"<p>The simplest way to convert your code into a class is to put all your code into the <code>getFeedback</code> method, except that instead of computing a guess which you send off to be evaluated, remember the guess in the property <code>self.guess</code>, and return that next time the <code>makeGuess</code> function is called. You'll also want to turn all your global variables (like <code>common</code>) into properties (like <code>self.common</code>). Here's a sketch:</p>

<pre><code>class CodeBreaker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.guess_count = 0
        self.guess = 'ABCD'
        self.common = []

    def makeGuess(self):
        return self.guess

    def getFeedback(self, feedback):
        self.guess_count += 1
        if self.guess_count == 1:
            # ... your code here ...
            self.guess = 'BCDE'
        elif self.guess_count == 2:
            # ... your code here ...
            self.guess = 'CDEF'
        elif self.guess_count == 3:
            # ... your code here ...
        # ... and so on ...
</code></pre>

<p>I should add that your code is very repetitive. The following changes would be worthwhile:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Python standard library already contains a function <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.product"" rel=""nofollow""><code>itertools.product</code></a> that does the job of your function <code>product</code> (though it takes its arguments in a different way), so you might as well use that instead.</p></li>
<li><p>You copy out essentially the same code for each guess (generating the set of combinations, evaluating the combinations against the most recent guess, updating <code>common</code> and so on). It should be straightforward to put this code into a method so that you don't have to copy it out so many times.</p></li>
<li><p>The code for guesses number 4 and higher is almost identical: surely there's no need to copy out this code at all (just write <code>if guesscount &gt;= 4:</code> and handle them all at the same time).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You might want to study this class (which uses a similar method to your solution, but with all the repetition cut out) and see if you can figure out how it works:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import product
from random import choice
from copy import copy

class CodeBreaker(object):
    all_codes = [''.join(c) for c in product(*['ABCDEF'] * 4)]

    def __init__(self):
        self.codes = copy(self.all_codes)
        self.guess = 'AABB'     # Best first guess!

    def makeGuess(self):
        return self.guess

    def getFeedback(self, feedback):
        self.codes = [c for c in self.codes if computeFeedback(c, self.guess) == feedback]
        self.guess = choice(self.codes)
</code></pre>

<p>This algorithm can take up to eight guesses in the worst case, but you have eight guesses available, so that's OK. If you had only six guesses available, then you'd need a cleverer approach. The following alternative algorithm makes the best guess based on one move of lookahead, and needs at most six guesses. (It runs very slowly, however!) Again, you might find it interesting to study how it works (hint: it takes the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax"" rel=""nofollow"">minimum of a list of maxima</a>).</p>

<pre><code>    def getFeedback(self, feedback):
        self.codes = [c for c in self.codes if computeFeedback(c, self.guess) == feedback]
        def key(g): return max(Counter(computeFeedback(c, g) for c in self.codes).values())
        self.guess = min(self.codes, key = key)
</code></pre>

<p>And here's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29#Five-guess_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">Knuth's five-guess algorithm</a> (which runs even slower):</p>

<pre><code>    def getFeedback(self, feedback):
        self.codes = [c for c in self.codes if computeFeedback(c, self.guess) == feedback]
        if len(self.codes) == 1:
            self.guess = self.codes[0]
        else:
            def key(g): return max(Counter(computeFeedback(c, g) for c in self.codes).values())
            self.guess = min(self.all_codes, key = key)
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. Your professor's code isn't perfect, either! Apart from not following conventional Python style (see <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow"">PEP8</a>), it also seems rather complex and long-winded. Why not take advantage of Python's <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#counter-objects"" rel=""nofollow""><code>collections.Counter</code></a> class to write something short and simple:</p>

<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def computeFeedback(code, guess):
    """"""
    Return the string `{white}w{black}b` where `black` is a count of the
    characters in `guess` that appear at the same position in `code`
    and `white` is a count of the characters in `guess` that appear at
    a different position in `code`.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; computeFeedback('ABCD', 'ACAD')

    """"""
    w = sum((Counter(code) &amp; Counter(guess)).values())
    b = sum(c == g for c, g in zip(code, guess))
    return '{}w{}b'.format(w - b, b)

<p>I ran into a similar error and was able to fix it, but when I try to apply the fixes, that did not work.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>  $doc('test')/set/entry[contains(., concat('!', $kw))],
  $doc('test')/set/entry[contains(., $kw)]
</code></pre>

<p>returns the same result.</p>

<p>Walking through the desired result:</p>

<p>The first <code>return</code> should return every <code>entry</code> and its children if the entry's <code>comment</code> child contains any of the three keywords in <code>$pKeywords</code>.</p>

<p><code>concat('!', $kw)</code> is supposed to make !-containing comments the priority.</p>

<p>The second <code>return</code> slices the <code>comment</code> and <code>buyer</code> nodes from the results of the first <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>As long as there is exactly 1 <code>comment</code>-named node in every entry, the code executes fine.  When there are 2 or more <code>comment</code>-named nodes, the code fails, and the compiler returns the error mentioned above:</p>

<p><code>Stopped at line 9, column 22: [XPTY0004] document-node()(...): function(item()*) as item()* expected, document-node() found.</code></p>

<li>Make sure you declare your structure field order (3.5.0 and later requires this; earlier depend on the JVM doing the expected thing if you don't specify it).</li>

12668083,"<p>If I understood you correctly, you are simply looking for a way to use an XSLT processor without having to use IIS (or another web server with added support for this feature). 
There are quite a few ways you can test XSLT transformations without having to install any software at all. A ton of different web pages will transform XML for you (given your XSLT and target XML). To name a few:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://www.xmlper.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xmlper.com/</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.online-toolz.com/tools/xslt-transformation.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.online-toolz.com/tools/xslt-transformation.php</a></li>
</ol>

<p>These online tools, though, normally utilize processors that conform to the XSLT 1.0 standard. This means that if you're planning on using XPath functions/other such rich features, you'll be better of downloading an IDE that specifically supports XSLT 2.0 transformations.</p>

<p>Commercial products include <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng"" rel=""nofollow"">Visual Studio</a>, <a href=""http://www.altova.com/xmlspy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Altova's XML Spy</a> etc.</p>

<p>I'm not too familiar with freeware products in this case, but I think you can also try using Netbeans IDE with the ""XML tools plugin"". (In case of using Netbeans: if you need XSLT 2.0 support, you will probably have to configure it to use a Saxon processor(supports XSLT2.0) instead of the default Xalan processor(supports XSLT1.0)).</p>

12668186,"<p>Firstly I must say that there is a problem with your method; <strong>a method must only do one thing</strong> and yours does two things (computes two values that you need to return). The proper solution would be to create another method which has the purpose of returning one of these values while the other is to be returned by the original method.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you really need to do this you have some options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a wrapper class that contains both the values as private fields and return from your method a value of this new class.</li>
<li>Extract one of the returned object as a field variable which is going to be read by other needing methods (if it is only needed by private methods).</li>
<li>If one of those returned types is an error status, use an exception.</li>

  <p>This is a embedded database, which means I am taking this from one machine to another and willing to start just by double clicking on the jar file,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of derby, an embedded database means that the database runs in the JVM and writes to the file system. Which implies that you can move the jar file around like you want, but if you use an embedded database, then each machine that you run the program on will have its own separate database, and one and only one JVM can use that database at a time. Is that what you want?</p>

<p>If so, the problem is the URL that the program uses. <code>""jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/contact;create=true""</code> is a URL that tells DriverManager to connect to a remote database. It doesn't matter that program loads the embedded driver first. </p>

<p>An embedded URL in Derby looks something like this. <code>jdbc:derby:bar;create=true</code> which will use an embedded database in the bar directory off of the Derby system home or current working directory. For more information on embedded urls, see here <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10666313/connecting-to-a-file-based-derby-database/10666543#10666543"">connecting to a file-based derby database</a>.</p>

  <p><em>How do I achieve this, making the constants accessible from both backing beans and XHTML files?</em></p>

<p>In backing beans, it's obviously easy. As they're just Java classes, it's not different from the ""normal"" Java way. You could use <code>enum</code>s or <code>public static final</code> fields. In views, this is a different story. Until the upcoming version 3.0, EL does namely not support constants in any way.</p>

<p>I'd suggest using enums as EL has implicit support for them in string comparisons. It does not do any compiletime/runtime type safety checks, but you can use the enum name as a string. E.g.</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h:someComponent ... rendered=""#{order.status == 'SHIPPING'}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you prefer more self documenting code and a runtime check (no, a compiletime check is not possible), then you could consider using <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/omnifaces/"" rel=""nofollow"">OmniFaces</a> <a href=""http://showcase.omnifaces.org/taghandlers/importConstants"" rel=""nofollow""><code>&lt;o:importConstants&gt;</code></a>.</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;o:importConstants type=""com.example.OrderStatus"" /&gt;
&lt;h:someComponent ... rendered=""#{order.status == OrderStatus.SHIPPING}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is IMO only a bit more clumsy. The runtime check is however nice during development. A typo is easily overseen.</p>

<p>In the upcoming EL 3.0 (<a href=""http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=341"" rel=""nofollow"">JSR-341</a>, part of Java EE 7), it will however be possible to reference constants by the new <code>T(classname)</code> keyword. See also <a href=""http://java.net/projects/el-spec/pages/StaticField"" rel=""nofollow"">EL 3.0 specification - Static fields and methods</a>. The above example can then be achieved as follows</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;h:someComponent ... rendered=""#{order.status == T(com.example.OrderStatus).SHIPPING}"" /&gt;

    angleC = Math.toDegrees(angleC);
    double cosB = ((a2+b2-c2)/(2*sideAB*sideBC));

12668289,"<p>Yes, the @InjectMocks annotation makes Mockito EITHER do constructor injection, OR setter/field injection, but NEVER both.  The rules around which will be chosen are quite complicated, which is one reason why I try to avoid using @InjectMocks whenever possible.  </p>

<p>To summarise, Mockito FIRST chooses one constructor from among those that the class has, THEN analyses whether that constructor can be used for constructor injection.  The one it chooses will always be the one with the greatest number of arguments.  If there are several constructors with the same number of arguments, then it is undefined which one will be chosen.</p>

<p>Constructor injection will NOT be used if the type of one or more of the parameters of the CHOSEN constructor is a primitive type, or a final class or a private class.  Even if there are other constructors that COULD be used.</p>

<p>If constructor injection is not used, or if the only constructor is the default constructor, then setter/field injection will be used instead.  But setter/field injection is never used in conjunction with constructor injection.</p>

12668294,"<p>As I put in my comment above, this is a typical functionality you should Access for (even when you prefer to use Excel as a front). What I see above is a table structure, food asked to be queried before being fed to the spreadsheet. </p>

<p>MS Access allows you to create indexes and searches based on index, which has the purpose to considerably increase your performance when you have many records. (The system will search based on the indexed records, rather than needing to run through every single record). If you are talking about a table with 10K records, I suspect Access is without a doubt better to go with.  </p>

<p>Although I don't recommend it, you can treat your Excel sheet as a database table using ADODB or DAO (Access uses native DAO) by adding a library reference to the file. 
This way you can use SQL to perform all CRUD operations on your datasheet.<br>
The reason why I don't recommend it, is because Excel is not meant to be replaced by a RDBMS (eg does not support relational db structures, which makes it harder to support and which makes that you need to manage your referential/data integrity through VBA or manually.<br>
Learning how to do a few basic things in Access may take you 1 day, but maintaining this system by programming everything (including checks and retrieving data from another sheet-table etc...) may take you forever. </p>

<p>Additionally:<br>
The reason why the code will be slow is because I suspect that you read and check every record explicitly line per line from the Excel sheet.<br>
If you still want to have this code run faster using loops, you need to read the entire range into an array and perform the checks in memory by looping through the array.<br>
I suspect the code execution to be acceptable but you can check its performance by setting a timer, and an additional notification of the progress on the statusbar (application.statusbar) displaying the counter. </p>

It comes out of the box with OCR built in and a database export module, plus a host of other built-in and add-on features that can help clean up documents for recognition, export, import and other functionality.  The big things you would need to consider would be scanner compatibility, scan volume and hardware requirements.  I've used this software a lot and am pretty happy with it.</p>

<p>The most important thing to think about when trying to do OCR on forms is that they're all the same for a given ""type"" of form.  If the layout of all your forms varies widely from one instance to the next you will have problems unless you can account for all the different variations (potentially a lot of work).  Might be a good time to review or revise the layout of your forms to be more usable with OCR.</p>

<p>I have also written C# extensions for Kofax Capture.  I would recommend training on this, even though there are some fairly good examples in the documentation, and it comes with the source code for a lot of different extensions right off the bat.  A lot of the samples are in VB.NET or VB6, but you can absolutely use C# for anything in the latest incarnation of Kofax Capture, to the best of my knowledge.

12668338,"<p>There is no way to change the look of that browse-away warning dialog.  It is a native facility provided by the browser.  In fact, on Firefox <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.onbeforeunload"" rel=""nofollow"">as of version 4</a> you can't even customize the message by supplying your own string as the return value, rather it always says something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This page is asking you to confirm that you want to leave - data you have entered may not be saved.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for excluding various components on your page from the browse-away warning, isn't that simply a matter of extending the technique that you already appear to be using, where you disable the onbeforeunload event in your user event handlers?  For example, when clicking the update button or the search button, you can first make sure to ""un-hook"" the onbeforeunload event by assigning it to null or a no-op function.</p>

<p>By the way, looking at all that raw DOM construction you are doing (all the <code>appendChild()</code> calls and <code>setAttribute()</code> calls, etc), I suggest you take a look at some client-side template frameworks.  <a href=""http://engineering.linkedin.com/frontend/client-side-templating-throwdown-mustache-handlebars-dustjs-and-more"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a decent-looking list of alternatives</a>.

",1349074669,12668754,True,"<p>I'm using JQuery to handle changes in unsaved form data, user enters the page, edits the data, tries to leave the page without saving and it sort of works since I'm getting the dialog when I've changed the form:

<p>Above says: ""Do you want to leave this page? You have unsaved data, do you want to conitnue without saving your changes?""</p>

<p>It works well and is a lot of functionality in very little code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    $(function() {
        // Set the unload message whenever any input element get changed.
        $(':input').on('change', function() {
            setConfirmUnload(true);
        });

        // Turn off the unload message whenever a form get submitted properly.
        $('form').on('submit', function() {
            setConfirmUnload(false);
        });
    });

    function setConfirmUnload(on) {
        var message = ""Vill du gå vidare utan att spara eventuella ändringar?"";
        window.onbeforeunload = (on) ? function() { return message; } : null;
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I don't see why you need the ""column"" where it was found, since in all cases you listed ""TeamId"".  If it were named different things in different tables instead, then you could use this:</p>

 where TeamId = 1
 union all 
 select 'TeamMember', 'Member_TeamId' from TeamMember

        if (Directory.Exists(PATCHSELECTOR))
        {
            string GamereliteFolder = Path.Combine(programFiles, @""GAMERELITE~1"");
            if (Directory.Exists(GamereliteFolder))
</code></pre>

<p>And then I move the files using the string method. If the file exists it is deleted before I copy the file over from PATCH SELECTOR to GAMERELITE.</p>

<p>Also will windows XP support using the .exe with an assembly resource embedded which is making the program need to be ran as administrator? I previously was making the assembly work through UAC however that wouldnt always work if they have UAC off or if it is XP so I thought I would try the admin assembly instead.</p>

The fact is when you are running your project with CTRL+F5 you are running WITHOUT debugging, and F5 ""debugging"".</p>

<p>So if you are facing exceptions while ""debugging"" and not while ""not debugging"" it seems to mean that those exceptions are properly catched. One way to get rid of those exceptions is to check within the Debug Menu / then Exceptions and to check that all ""Thrown"" checkboxes are unchecked. This Exception window is there to force debug process to break in case of Exception even if they are properly catched.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We cannot make this change for compatibility reaons.  Furthermore, we
  would expect that getConstructor should behave analogously to getDeclaredMethod,
  which also requires an exact match, thus it does not make sense to change one
  without changing the other.  It would be possible to add an additional suite of
  methods that differed only in the way in which the argument types were matched,
  however.
  There are certainly cases where we might want to apply at runtime during
  reflection the same overload-resolution algorithm used statically by the
  compiler, i.e., in a debugger.  It is not difficult to implement this
  functionality with the existing API, however, so the case for adding this
  functionality to core reflection is weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That bug report was closed as a duplicate of the following one, which provides a bit more implementation detail:
<a href=""http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=1b08c721077da9fffffffff1e9a6465911b4e?bug_id=4287725"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=1b08c721077da9fffffffff1e9a6465911b4e?bug_id=4287725</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work Around<br>
  Users of getMethod must be precise identifying the Class passed to the argument.</p>
  
  <p>Evaluation<br>
  The essence of this request is that the user would like for Class.getMethod
  to apply the same overloading rules as the compiler does.  I think this is
  a reasonable request, as I see a need for this arising frequently in certain
  kinds of reflective programs, such as debuggers and scripting interpreters,
  and it would be helpful to have a standard implementation so that everybody
  gets it right.  For compatibility, however, the behavior of the existing
  Class.getMethod should be left alone, and a new method defined.  There is
  a case for leaving this functionality out on the basis of footprint, as it
  can be implemented using existing APIs, albeit somewhat inefficiently.
  See also 4401287.
  Consensus appears to be that we should provide overload resolution in
  reflection.  Exactly when such functionality is provided would depend largely 
  on interest and potential uses.<br>
  For compatibility reasons, the Class.get(Declared)+{Method,Constructor}
  implementation should not change; new method should be introduced.  The
  specification for these methods does need to be modified to define ""match"".  See
  bug 4651775.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can keep digging into those referenced bugs and the actual links I provided (where there's discussion as well as possible workarounds) but I think that gets at the reasoning (though why a new method reflecting java's oop in reflection as well has not yet been implemented, I don't know).</p>

<p>In terms of workarounds, I suppose that for the one-level-deep version of inheritance, you can just call getSuperclass() on each class whose name is that of the extending class, but that's extremely inelegant and tied to you using it only on your classes implementing in the prescribed manner.  Very kludgy.  I'll try and look for another option though.</p>
",1349073323,12668505,True,"<p>I generally oppose extension since it creates a very strong connection between classes, which is easy to accidentally break.</p>

<p>However, I finally thought I'd found a reasonable case for it - I want to optionally use a compressed version of a file type in an existing system. The compressed version would be almost as quick as the uncompressed, and would have exactly the same methods available (i.e. read and write) - the only difference would be in the representation on disk. Therefore, I had the compressed version extend the uncompressed version so that either kind of file could be used, just by optionally insantiating the other type.</p>

<pre><code>public class CompressedSpecialFile extends SpecialFile(){ ... }

if (useCompression){
    SpecialFile = new CompressedSpecialFile();
} else {
    SpecialFile = new SpecialFile();
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, at a later point in the program, we use reflection:</p>

<pre><code>Object[] values = new Object[]{SpecialFile sf, Integer param1, String param2, ...}
Class myclass = Class.forName(algorithmName);
Class[] classes = // created by calling .getClass on each object in values
constructor = myclass.getConstructor(classes); 
Algorithm = (Algorithm) constructor.newInstance(values)
</code></pre>

<p>Which all worked fine, but now the myclass.getConstructor class throws a NoSuchMethodException since the run-time type of the SpecialFile is CompressedSpecialFile.</p>

<p>However, I thought that was how extension is supposed to work - since CompressedSpecialFile extends SpecialFile, any parameter accepting a SpecialFile should accept a CompressedSpecialFile. Is this an error in Java's reflection, or a failure of my understanding?</p>

<p>So, presumably either table can have more than one record per login_id, which is why you're doing the sum and group by.  However, take a look at what your query gives you back when you take out the aggregates and the group by and I think you may understand the problem.</p>

<p>Let's say you have table 1 which has 2 records for login_id xxx1234 and table 2 which has 3 records for that login_id.  Then when you left join them, you will get <strong>6 records</strong>.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>table 1:
  login, custotal
  xxx111, 10
  xxx111, 20

table 2:
  login, amount
  xxx111, 30
  xxx111, 40
  xxx111, 50

after the join:
  login, custotal, amount
  xxx111 10, 30
  xxx111 10, 40
  xxx111 10, 50
  xxx111 20, 30

<p>1) Match the whole portion you are interested in with a simple Regex:</p>

<pre><code>GetDelay.Pattern = ""is sadly currently in (.*?) undetermined""

<p>2) Once you have matched the portion of interest, perform further analysis to get what you want.

<blockquote>

<p>I tested my regex in Expresso and found this regex for my purpose. The thing is: Toronto main station can also be only ""Toronto"". So this is my pattern:</p>

<pre><code>is sadly currently in (([A-Za-z]*)(\s|-)){1,3}(.|\s)*?undetermined
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is processing the regex in VB, because my Pattern gives me a result like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>is sadly currently in Toronto main station undetermined
<ul>
<li>undetermined 
<ul>
<li>Toronto</li>
<li>Main</li>
<li>undetermined</li>

<li>undetermined 
<ul>
<li>Toronto</li>
<li>Main</li>
<li>undetermined
....</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>But I cannot access the words toronto and main via VB - also I dont want 'undetermined' be part of the result. I tried <code>match.item(0).submatches.item(0).submatches.item(0)</code> but VBA already throws an error if I try <code>match.item(0).submatches.item(0).submatches</code> and states that there is no such object - obviously it cannot process some those ""multilevel"" regexes. Is there a way to improve my pattern so that I only have to use one submatches or is it possible to use multiple submatches via VBA?!</p>

<p>I have a question about disable button after ajax submit.
Actually the button disabled first until I input text to textarea. Then if I submit with click button, it must disable the button.</p>

<p>In my actual, after click button, the button isn't disabled.</p>

<p>Here it's my JS code :</p>

<pre><code>$(function()
    {
        $(""#submit_h"").click(function() 
        {
            var haps = $(""#haps"").val();
            var dataString = 'haps='+ haps;
            if(haps=='')
            {
                alert('Please type your haps');
            }
            else
            {
                $.ajax({
                type: ""POST"",
                url: ""post_haps.php"",
                data: dataString,
                cache: false,
                success: function(html){
                $(""#haps"").val('');
                $(""#content"").prepend(html);
                }
                });
            }return false;
        });
    });

 but without having to refer to a Database or using Sql
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you use multiple servers you create a processes somewhere that only registers logins and logouts. You have it called whenever one of the two happens. You can use that process to check whether a user is already logged in. You can loadbalance this process by, for instance, running it on all servers and use an algorithm to use serverx only for a subset of the users. Say you have 10 servers, do (userId % 10) to get the Id of the server a user registers login/logout with. </p>

<p>This way you do these checks only in memory with calls between servers. Possibly you will need a timeout/refreshcall so users that disconnect or servers that crash will not keep users logged in forever. </p>

<li>player 1 makes a strike (we refer to a chart to convert blows to hitpoints with random-range %)</li>
<li>player 2 has 92HP, and returns a light blow, so player1 has 98hp</li>

<p>There are other columns such as armor , mana, spells , which all get carried forward for each player , in total there are 48 columns - 12 for each player and their attributes</p>

<p>Finally there is a gameResult table that has result of a tournament , with tournamentid, tournament_timestamp, gameresult (complete, PlayerSurrender, InvalidSession , SecurityHack, TimeOut), winnerPlayer , playerMetrics , rowIDfrom, rowIDto</p>

",1349080371,12669866,False,"<p>I have a locally hosted WCF service where I try to use WCF's CollectionDataContract.</p>

<p>The Service-contract looks like this:</p>

<p>The GetSalesDeliveryNotesResponse-class has a property Serials which looks like this:</p>

    public SerialList(List&lt;string&gt; l) : base() {

<p>where r is a collection of XElements (the service connects to an Oracle database, executes a stored procedure which returns an XML which my service has to serialize to the client).</p>

<p>Note that the DeliveryNote, Order and Orderline are also inner classes of the Response-object, but are omitted for brevity (as are a couple of other properties).</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is that the Serials-object in my response (client-side) looks like this:</p>

<p>Tip - for sanity's sake I worked on the python over in a side text editor and pasted it into lldb as I experimented.</p>

<p>If you use the frame variable command in lldb to explore your variables at a given stop location, that's the same basic way that you can access them via the SBFrame that is provided to your breakpoint python command in the 'frame' object.</p>

<p>Hope that helps to get you started.</p>
",1349082680,12670389,True,"<p>As part of debugging a problem that might be related to my UIVIews, I want to write a python script to run from LLDB. I had thought to extract all settings for a view in a breakpoint and all view children, to allow me to compare states. I checked out the WWDC video on the topic and then spent time reading things at lldb.llvm.org/scripting.html, and didn't find them very helpful. A web search for examples led to nothing substantially different from those.</p>

<p>My problem is that I'm trying to figure out how to access iOS variables at my breakpoint. The examples I've seen do things like convert numbers and mimic shell commands. Interesting stuff but not useful for my purposes. I've been reading my way through the help info with ""script help(lldb.SBValue)"" and the like, but it is slow going as the results are huge and it is not clear what the use patterns are.

Currently its wrong, its waiting until the exec gets complete and then moves to next. Where i need to on the fly let the exec running so that after 10 second later it can kill the PresentationInProjector.jpg.</p>

   Runtime.getRuntime().exec(""(sleep 10; echo '09|00|CC|01|83|88' | nc localhost 58888) &amp;"");

12668858,"<p>The biggest issue I'm seeing is that you're specifying a width for those li's as ""0.2%"", which just displays as a solid black line for me, even with content inside them.
Second, you may also be referring to the fact that there's more purple between the li's than there is to the left.  That is because you have a left and right margin set at 20px.  This means that the left-most li is 20 px from the left, and 20px from the right of the next li which has a 20px margin to its left.
Essentially you have 20 px to the left of the left-most li, 20px margin to the right of the right-most, and 40px (20 + 20) between them all.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend lemmatization for your specific needs:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
&gt;&gt;&gt; lmtzr = WordNetLemmatizer()
&gt;&gt;&gt; lmtzr.lemmatize('dance')

'dancer'

'dancing'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lmtzr.lemmatize('dances')
'dance'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lmtzr.lemmatize('danced')
'danced'
</code></pre>

<p>Substrings are not a good idea because it will always fail at a certain point, and many times fail miserably.</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed-length: pseudo-words 'dancitization' and 'dancendence' will match 'dance' at 4 and 5 characters respectively.</li>
<li>ratio: a low ratio will return fakes (like above)</li>
<li>ratio: a high ratio will not match enough (e.g. 'running')</li>
</ul>

<p>But with stemming you get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; stemmer.stem('dancitization')
u'dancit'
&gt;&gt;&gt; stemmer.stem('dancendence')
u'dancend'
&gt;&gt;&gt; #since dancitization gives us dancit, let's try dancization to get danc
&gt;&gt;&gt; stemmer.stem('dancization')
u'dancize'
&gt;&gt;&gt; stemmer.stem('dancation')
u'dancat'

<p>Which is an impressive no-match result for the stem ""danc"". Even considering 'dancer' does not stem to 'danc', the accuracy is pretty high overall.</p>

",1349082130,12670269,True,"<p>I'm looking for a way to produce a numerical probability value for single words which share a common root word/meaning.</p>

<p>Users will generate content using words like ""dancer,"" ""dancing,"" ""danced.""</p>

<p>If ""dancer"" is submitted 30 times, and dancing 5 times, I need just one value ""dance:35"" which catches all of them.</p>

<p>But when users also submit words like ""accordance,"" it should not effect my ""dance"" count, but instead, add to a sperate count along with words like ""according"" and ""accordingly.""</p>

<p>Also, I don't have a pre-defined list of root words to look out for. I'll need to create it  dynamically based on that user-generated content. </p>

<p>So my question is, what's probably the best way to pull this off? I'm sure there will be no perfect solution, but I figure someone on here can probably can come up with a better way than me.</p>

<p>My idea so far is to assume that most meaningful words will have at least 3 or 4 letters. So for every word I encounter whose length is greater than 4, trim it down to 4 (""dancers"" becomes ""danc""), check my list of words to see if I've encountered it before, if so - increment it's count, and if not - add it to that list, repeat. </p>

<p>I see there are some similar questions on here. But I haven't found any answer which considers roots AND I can implement in python. Answers seem to be for one or the other. </p>

One of them is that IPFIX allows for per-vendor namespaces in the field type numbers using the PrivateEnterpriseNumber.   NetFlow v9 does not have such a facility, therefore vendors have to arbitrarily choose a range of numbers to report their custom fields on and hope no one else picks the same range.

<p>However this only works for MATMAS. When I change a material in MM02, my idoc is created with complete segments, not only with changed segments. However this enhancement does not work for DEBMAS!?!? Anyone knows why?</p>

<p>I need to find out how to send my DEBMAS idoc completely to my other system.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>One way is to create a symbolic link, so you would use the underlaying operating system to fool red5 that there is a file existing.
You will then have to add Listeners in your ApplicationAdapter to listen to the needed events.
For example:

<p>The second solution would be to write a custom stream Handler. However this would need further investigation. I don't think that there is a standard mechanism to modify the file request to apply some kind of wildcard to it.
It would work similar to the first solution, but you would need to rewrite/overwrite some of the mechanisms of the ApplicationAdapter to that process file requests.</p>

<p><em>Do you actually need an <code>Integer[]</code> and not an <code>int[]</code>, by the way (i.e. you can have <code>null</code> values)?</em> As you've said in the comments, you don't really need an <code>Integer[]</code>, so using <code>ints</code>s everywhere will avoid boxing/unboxing and will save a lot of space since you appear to have lots of them. Hopefully you don't have a huge number of possible values for the last element (x).</p>

<p>You then create an instance for each array and read the last element to put it the <code>Multimap</code> without keeping the array around. Populating the <code>Multimap</code> needs to be either sequential or protected with a lock if concurrent, but reading can be concurrent without any protection. You could even create an <code>ImmutableMultimap</code> once the <code>HashMultimap</code> has been populated, to guard against any modification, a safe practice in a concurrent environment.</p>

",1349260199,12706613,True,"<p>I am building an MVC4 application and need to use external authentication (Facebook, etc). I have that working fine. I see the SimpleMembershipProvider creates 2 separate tables to handle this: ""<strong>webpages_Membership</strong>"" and ""<strong>webpages_OAuthMembership</strong>"". I need to map other tables (foreign keys) to User ID. The problem is both tables have a user ID which are unrelated to each other.. I could ignore the foreign keys in the database if necessary (don't like that though), but the bigger question is this: in code, how would I determine whether a user is authorized externally or locally so that I know where to get his other info from? Specifically, I have a user profile table where I will map other attributes to.. having 2 different types of user, how does one go about this?</p>

<p>Then, the first thing you must do is understand the compiler error. What is trying to say the compiler?</p>

<p>In the <code>B</code> constructor you're initializing a member of the type <code>const A **</code> with a given parameter of the type <code>const A &amp;</code>; they aren't of the same type and this is why the compiler is complaining.</p>

<p>So, what to do to fix it?</p>

<p>You must make the <code>B</code> constructor to take the same type of the member variable as argument.</p>

<pre><code>class B
{
private:
    const A** theArray;
public:
    B(const A**);
};

B::B(const A** newA)
    : theArray(newA) //&lt;-- They're of the same type: no problem.
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>But you must ensure that the calls outside the class matches the constructor definition.</p>

<p>But instead of it, I advise to revise the design, you're sure that naked pointers is the only solution to your problem? You must answer this questions in order to improve the <code>class B</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where the dynamic memory is created an where is destroyed?</li>
<li>The <code>class B</code> takes the ownership of the given <code>A**</code>?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the <code>class B</code> will be the owner of the dynamic memory, you must think about creating and destroying the <code>theArray</code> inside the <code>class B</code> itself not outside.</p>

<p>If the <code>class B</code> will not be the owner of the dynamic memory, you must be very careful about the memory: The memory pointed by <code>theArray</code> will be destroyed after of before the <code>class B</code>? in other words, could be a <code>class B</code> instance with memory pointed by <code>theArray</code> already deleted? In this case, smart pointers could be a good help.</p>

<p>edit 1:
this is for a comsci class assignment. We're learning about classes right now and the assignment has us creating three separate constructors for this particular class (a copy constructor; one to add a new A object into 'theArray' in class B; and a constructor that add the first A object into 'theArray'(this is the constructor in question).) </p>

<p>The idea is that you call the third constructor in the list to create an object. Then if you want to add another A object to the array you would call the second constructor. Then if you wanted a copy of the object you would use the copy constructor</p>

<p>This will,m of course, render the <code>RewriteRule admin/$ index.php?view=admin [QSA]</code> rule useless, or at the very least, cause some conflicts. So you should either comment that rule out, or create a special exception where all traffic except <code>admin/</code> gets redirected.</p>

<p>Here's one way to do it, I'm only guessing that this is the behavior you want. This stuff does not change, it's fine the way it is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Files .htaccess&gt;
order allow,deny

<p>Add a:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/(index\.php|admin)
RewriteRule ^/?.+$ / [L,R]

RewriteRule admin/$ index.php?view=admin [QSA,L]

<p>So putting all that together, you have the <strong>deny</strong> for accessing <em>.htaccess</em> files. Then you have your <code>Options</code>, then your rewrite rules.
